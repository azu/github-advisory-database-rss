To exploit the vulnerability: 1) the attacker needs to have privileges to control JDBC connection parameters; 2) and there should be a vulnerable class (constructor with URL parameter and ability to execute code) in the classpath. From Apache Calcite Avatica 1.22.0 onwards, it will be verified that the class implements the expected interface before invoking its constructor.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em></p>
<p>The PGJDBC implementation of the <code>java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()</code> method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. <code>;</code>, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user.</p>
<p>User applications that do not invoke the <code>ResultSet.refreshRow()</code> method are not impacted.</p>
<p>User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the <code>refreshRow()</code> method on the ResultSet.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE refresh_row_example (
  id     int PRIMARY KEY,
  "1 FROM refresh_row_example; SELECT pg_sleep(10); SELECT * " int
);
</code></pre>
<p>This example has a table with two columns. The name of the second column is crafted to contain a statement terminator followed by additional SQL. Invoking the <code>ResultSet.refreshRow()</code> on a ResultSet that queried this table, e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM refresh_row</code>, would cause the additional SQL commands such as the <code>SELECT pg_sleep(10)</code> invocation to be executed.</p>
<p>As the multi statement command would contain multiple results, it would not be possible for the attacker to get data directly out of this approach as the <code>ResultSet.refreshRow()</code> method would throw an exception. However, the attacker could execute any arbitrary SQL including inserting the data into another table that could then be read or any other DML / DDL statement.</p>
<p>Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>
<p>TBD.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>
<p>Check that you are not using the <code>ResultSet.refreshRow()</code> method.</p>
<p>If you are, ensure that the code that executes that method does not connect to a database that is controlled by an unauthenticated or malicious user. If your application only connects to its own database with a fixed schema with no DDL permissions, then you will not be affected by this vulnerability as it requires a maliciously crafted schema.</p>

<p>ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server.  However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server).  This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line.</p>
<p><em>This vulnerability does NOT impact 7.x.</em></p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed in 5.11 via commit: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199</a></li>

</ul>
<h4 id="apply-the-patch-to-your-dspace">Apply the patch to your DSpace</h4>
<p>If at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the appropriate patch file to the machine where DSpace is running</li>
<li>From the <code>[dspace-src]</code> folder, apply the patch, e.g. <code>git apply [name-of-file].patch</code></li>
<li>Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:<ol>
<li>Rebuild DSpace, e.g. <code>mvn -U clean package</code>  (This will recompile all DSpace code)</li>
<li>Redeploy DSpace, e.g. <code>ant update</code>  (This will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.</li>
<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>As a basic workaround, you may block all access to the following URL paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to <code>/admin/batchimport</code> path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path "/xmlui", then you'd need to block access to <code>/xmlui/admin/batchimport</code>.</li>
<li>If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to <code>/dspace-admin/batchimport</code> path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool).  Keep in mind, if your site uses the path "/jspui", then you'd need to block access to <code>/jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.</p>

<li>From the <code>[dspace-src]</code> folder, apply the patch, e.g. <code>git apply [name-of-file].patch</code></li>
<li>Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:<ol>
<li>Rebuild DSpace, e.g. <code>mvn -U clean package</code>  (This will recompile all DSpace code)</li>
<li>Redeploy DSpace, e.g. <code>ant update</code>  (This will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.</li>
<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>As a basic workaround, you may block all access to the following URL paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to <code>/admin/batchimport</code> path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path "/xmlui", then you'd need to block access to <code>/xmlui/admin/batchimport</code>.</li>
<li>If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to <code>/dspace-admin/batchimport</code> path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool).  Keep in mind, if your site uses the path "/jspui", then you'd need to block access to <code>/jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.</p>

<p>The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, by modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights). This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI.</p>

<h4 id="apply-the-patch-to-your-dspace">Apply the patch to your DSpace</h4>
<p>If at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the appropriate patch file to the machine where DSpace is running</li>
<li>From the <code>[dspace-src]</code> folder, apply the patch, e.g. <code>git apply [name-of-file].patch</code></li>
<li>Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:<ol>

<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>As a workaround, you can temporarily disable the "Request a Copy" feature by either commenting out the below configuration (or setting its value to empty):</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Once your JSPUI site is patched, you can re-enable this setting. See <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC6x/Request+a+Copy">https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC6x/Request+a+Copy</a> for more information on this setting.</p>

<h4 id="apply-the-patch-to-your-dspace">Apply the patch to your DSpace</h4>
<p>If at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the appropriate patch file to the machine where DSpace is running</li>
<li>From the <code>[dspace-src]</code> folder, apply the patch, e.g. <code>git apply [name-of-file].patch</code></li>
<li>Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions). This generally involves three steps:<ol>
<li>Rebuild DSpace, e.g. <code>mvn -U clean package</code>  (This will recompile all DSpace code)</li>
<li>Redeploy DSpace, e.g. <code>ant update</code>  (This will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.</li>
<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
</ol>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Metadata on a withdrawn Item is exposed via the XMLUI "mets.xml" object, as long as you know the handle/URL of the withdrawn Item. This vulnerability only impacts the XMLUI.</p>
<p>However, this vulnerability is very low severity as Item metadata does not tend to contain highly secure or sensitive information.</p>
<p><em>This vulnerability does NOT impact the JSPUI or 7.x.</em></p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Because of the low severity of this security issue, it requires updating to 6.4 to resolve.  <em>No patch is available for 5.x or below.</em></p>

<h3 id="workaround">Workaround</h3>
<p>If there are any withdrawn items which are known to have highly secure information in their metadata, they can be permanently deleted. This will ensure their secure metadata is inaccessible &amp; removed from the system entirely.</p>

<p>When an "Internal System Error" occurs in the JSPUI, then entire exception (including stack trace) is available. Information in this stacktrace may be useful to an attacker in launching a more sophisticated attack.  This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI.</p>
<p><em>This vulnerability does NOT impact the XMLUI or 7.x.</em></p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>DSpace 6.x:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed in 6.4 via commit: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/afcc6c3389729b85d5c7b0230cbf9aaf7452f31a">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/afcc6c3389729b85d5c7b0230cbf9aaf7452f31a</a></li>

</ul>
<p><em>DSpace 5.x:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The 6.x patch file can also be applied to an older 5.x installation.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can simply apply the workaround documented below.  The detailed error information embedded in <code>internal.jsp</code> is not necessary for the JSPUI to function.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="apply-the-patch-to-your-dspace">Apply the patch to your DSpace</h4>
<p>If at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually apply the above patches as follows:</p>

<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The detailed error information embedded in <code>internal.jsp</code> is not necessary for the JSPUI to function.  Because this error information is also available in the <code>dspace.log</code> files, it does not need to be displayed in <code>internal.jsp</code>.</p>
<p>Modify your <code>internal.jsp</code>, and disable the display of the error message. This is most easily done by setting the returned exception to "null" at all times.  For example, add a new line between line number 43 and 44</p>
<pre><code>// This line should exist around line number 43
Throwable ex = (Throwable) request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.exception");
// Add workaround for security issue. Ensure exception is always set to null.
ex = null;
// This line should exist around line number 44
if(ex == null) out.println("No stack trace available&lt;br/&gt;");
</code></pre>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>When establishing a server-mode <code>TLSSocket</code> using <code>fs2-io</code> on Node.js, the parameter <code>requestCert = true</code> is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>fs2-io</code> running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent.</li>
<li><code>TLSSocket</code>s in server-mode. Client-mode <code>TLSSocket</code>s are implemented via a different API.</li>
<li>mTLS as enabled via <code>requestCert = true</code> in <code>TLSParameters</code>. The default setting is <code>false</code> for server-mode <code>TLSSocket</code>s.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in v3.1.0.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>A patch is released in v3.2.11. The <code>requestCert = true</code> parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a <code>SSLException</code> is raised.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode <code>TLSSocket</code> with <code>requestCert = true</code> to establish a mTLS connection.</p>
