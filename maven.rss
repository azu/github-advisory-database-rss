        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dojo Dojo Objective Harness (DOH) version prior to version 1.14 contains a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in <code>unit.html</code> and <code>testsDOH/_base/loader/i18n-exhaustive/i18n-test/unit.html</code> and <code>testsDOH/_base/i18nExhaustive.js</code> in the DOH that can result in Victim attacked through their browser - deliver malware, steal HTTP cookies, bypass CORS trust. This attack appear to be exploitable via Victims are typically lured to a web site under the attacker's control; the XSS vulnerability on the target domain is silently exploited without the victim's knowledge. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.14.</p>

<p>The proxy mode of WireMock, can be protected by the network restrictions configuration, as documented in <a href="https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses">Preventing proxying to and recording from specific target addresses</a>. These restrictions can be configured using the domain names, and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar patch was applied in WireMock 3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions.</p>
<p>The root cause of the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition triggered by a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial validation and the outbound network request that might go to a domain that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service is required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity and limited impact.</p>
<h3 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>WireMock 3,x until 3.0.3 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network</li>
<li>WireMock 2.x until 2.35.1 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network</li>
<li>Python WireMock until 2.6.1</li>
<li>WireMock Studio - all versions, this proprietary product was discontinued in 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<ul>
<li>WireMock 3.0.3 + the 3.0.3-1 Docker image</li>
<li>WireMock 2.35.1 + the 2.35.1-1 Docker image - backport to WireMock 2.x</li>
<li>Python WireMock 2.6.1</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>For WireMock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Configure WireMock to use IP addresses instead of the domain names in the outbound URLs subject to DNS rebinding</li>
<li>Option 2: Use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations</li>
</ul>
<p>For WireMock Studio: N/A. Switch to another distribution, there will be no fix provided. The vendor of former WireMock Studio recommends migration to <a href="https://www.wiremock.io/product">WireMock Cloud</a></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>On Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of <code>File.createTempFile(..)</code> results in temporary files being created with the permissions <code>-rw-r--r--</code>. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a type of schedule file which requires the creation of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could locate these transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read the schedule being processed by MPXJ.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The problem has been patched, MPXJ version 10.14.1 and later includes the necessary changes.</p>

<p>WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. <a href="https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses">Documentation</a>. </p>
<p>Until WireMock Webhooks Extension <a href="https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta-15">3.0.0-beta-15</a>, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the <code>limitProxyTargets</code> settings. </p>
<p>Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers.</p>
<h3 id="affected--components">Affected  components</h3>

<li>WireMock 3.x version until 3.0.3 (security patch)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="patches-and-mitigation">Patches and Mitigation</h3>

<p>NOTE: It was confirmed that <a href="https://www.wiremock.io/product">WireMock Cloud</a> does not expose sensitive internal APIs and hence not vulnerable to the issue. No action is needed if you use this SaaS distribution.</p>
