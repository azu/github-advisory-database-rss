It has the potential to create a denial-of-service to all contracts that can invoke the <a href=\"https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/315/why-are-selfdestructs-used-in-contract-programming#347\"><code>selfdestruct</code></a> function to destroy a smart contract. </p>\n<h2 id=\"users-impacted\">Users Impacted</h2>\n<p>Due to the successfully coordinated security vulnerability disclosure, no smart contracts were impacted through the use of this vulnerability. Smart contract states and storage values are not affected by this vulnerability. User funds and balances are safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disclosure\">Disclosure</h2>\n<p>In Ethermint running versions before <code>v0.17.2</code>, the contract <code>selfdestruct</code> invocation permanently removes the corresponding bytecode from the internal database storage. However, due to a bug in the <a href=\"https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/c9d42d667b753147977a725e98ed116c933c76cb/x/evm/keeper/statedb.go#L199-L203\"><code>DeleteAccount</code></a> function, all contracts that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same <code>CodeHash</code>) will also stop working once one contract invokes <code>selfdestruct</code>, even though the other contracts did not invoke the <code>selfdestruct</code> OPCODE.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-details\">Additional Details</h3>\n<p>The same contract bytecode can be deployed multiple times to create multiple contract instances. In the internal database, the bytecode is stored as a key-value entry <code>bytecode hash --&gt; bytecode</code> which is shared by those contracts. Unfortunately, when one of the contracts invokes <code>selfdestruct</code>, it will remove the corresponding <code>bytecode hash -&gt; bytecode</code> entry, and thus it disables all the contracts that share the same bytecode.</p>\n<p>The attack scenario is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The malicious attacker identifies a vulnerable contract that can invoke <code>selfdestruct</code></li>\n<li>The attacker deploys a copy of the contract with identical bytecode</li>\n<li>Finally, the attacker triggers the <code>selfdestruct</code> operation on their redeployed contract, actively causing a DoS on the original and vulnerable contract. All transactions will fail until a workaround is used (see below).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"patches\">Patches</h2>\n<p><em>Has the problem been patched?
