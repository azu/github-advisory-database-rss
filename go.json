With \"setenforce 0\" set, which is not at all advised, the root file system is open for modification with this exploit.  With \"setenfoce 1\" set, which is the recommendation, files can not be changed.  However, the contents of the <code>/</code> directory can be displayed.  I.e., <code>ls -alF /</code> will show the contents of the host directory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>Unknown.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf\">https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/9de9c20ff368beb84b84fe660773d352519dc1c5\">https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/9de9c20ff368beb84b84fe660773d352519dc1c5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/3deda19137f5dec0285bbb832bd93c22d860b087\">https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/3deda19137f5dec0285bbb832bd93c22d860b087</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/a030f7b8cd373075affef1f86de43a87e502f3d8\">https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/a030f7b8cd373075affef1f86de43a87e502f3d8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513\">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
