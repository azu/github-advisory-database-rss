However, fuzzing of higher level functions such as sign and verify were unable to produce incorrect results and there has been no reported occurrences of this issue being encountered in production use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>During the course of differential fuzzing of the blst library by @guidovranken it was discovered that blst would produce the incorrect result for some input values in the inverse function. This was the result of the introduction of a new inversion formula in version v0.3.0. This source of these incorrect outputs was due to two issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of inner loop iterations was not sufficient for the algorithm to converge.</li>\n<li>It was erroneously assumed that the absolute value of the intermediate result would be capped at 767-bits. As a result, some output values were truncated by one bit or the most significant bit was misinterpreted as the sign.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This issue has been resolved in the v0.3.3 release and users are recommended to upgrade immediately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>The software used to uncover this issue can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>A special thanks to Guido Vranken (@guidovranken) for his discovery and disclosure of this vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@supranational.net\">hello@supranational.net</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/supranational/blst/security/advisories/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p\">https://github.com/supranational/blst/security/advisories/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, <a href=\"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5219\">we added a new <code>Timestamp</code> field to <code>Evidence</code> structs</a>. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) </p>\n<p>In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the <code>consensus</code> reactor is responsible for forming <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still “in flight” when it is being formed by the <code>consensus</code> reactor. It hasn’t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different “last commits” when assigning a timestamp to <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence.</code></p>\n<p>In turn, different nodes could form <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. </p>\n<p>Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> is no longer formed by the <code>consensus</code> reactor; rather, the <code>consensus</code> reactor passes the <code>Vote</code>s themselves into the <code>EvidencePool</code>, which is now responsible for forming <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code>. The <code>EvidencePool</code> has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that <code>DuplicateVoteEvidence</code> formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. </p>\n<p>This release changes the API between the <code>consensus</code> and <code>evidence</code> reactors. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This is a denial-of-service vector which impacts networks running Tendermint Core v0.34.0 - v0.34.2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h3>\n<p>This problem has been patched in Tendermint Core v0.34.3.
