For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified.</p>\n<p>For HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. By setting the following connection header, the X-Forwarded-Host header can, for example, be removed:</p>\n<p>Connection: close, X-Forwarded-Host</p>\n<p>Depending on how the receiving application handles such cases, security implications may arise. Moreover, some application frameworks (e.g. Django) first transform the \"-\" to \"_\" signs, making it possible for the HTTP client to even modify these headers in these cases.</p>\n<p>This is similar to <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31813\">CVE-2022-31813</a> for Apache HTTP Server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>It was found that the following headers can be removed in this way (i.e. by specifing them within a connection header):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Host</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Port</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Proto</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Server</li>\n<li>X-Real-Ip</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert-Info</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>The following docker-compose file has been used for a simple setup:</p>\n<pre><code>services:\n  traefik:\n    image: traefik:v3.1\n    container_name: traefik\n    ports:\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\n      - ./traefik.yaml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yaml\n      - ./traefik-certs:/certs\n\n  python-http:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    container_name: python-http\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.rule=Host(`python.example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.entrypoints=websecure\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.tls=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.services.python-http.loadbalancer.server.port=8080\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following traefik.yaml has been used:</p>\n<pre><code>providers:\n  docker:\n    exposedByDefault: false\n    watch: true\n  file:\n    fileName: /etc/traefik/traefik.yaml\n    watch: true\n\nentryPoints:\n  websecure:\n    address: \":443\"\n\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    - certFile: /certs/server-cert.pem\n      keyFile: /certs/server-key.pem\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Python container just includes a simple Python HTTP server that prints the HTTP headers it receives.

As there is no X-Forwarded-Host header present in the request, the X_forwarded_host header will be used. </p>\n<p>It should be noted that when X-Forwarded-Host is present and a X_forwarded_host header is sent, usually the first occurence of the header will be used, which is in this case X-Forwarded-Host.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the headers X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert and X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert-Info are also affected. Here, client certificate authentication would need to be enabled in the Traefik setup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact-1\">Impact</h3>\n<p>All applications that trust the custom headers set by Traefik are affected by this vulnerability. As an example, assume that a backend application trusts Traefik to validate client certificates and trusts therefore the values that are sent within the X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert header, but does not validate the certificate anew.</p>\n<p>If the header is removed via the vulnerability, and the application framework allows for alternative names (e.g. by transforming the headers to lower case, and \"-\" to \"_\"), an attacker can place his own X_Forwarded_TLS_Client_Cert header in the request. This could lead to privilege escalation, as the attacker may put an (invalid) certificate in this header that would just be accepted by the application, but may contain other data than the certificate that is presented to Traefik for Client Certificate Authentication.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if the backend application uses any of the other custom headers for security-sensitive operations, the removal or modification of these headers may also security implications (e.g. access control bypass).</p>\n<p>The severity is the same as for <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31813\">CVE-2022-31813</a> for Apache HTTP Server, i.e. 9.8 Critical.</p>\n</details>\n### References\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv\">https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/584144100524277829f26219baaab29a53b8134f\">https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/584144100524277829f26219baaab29a53b8134f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.9\">https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.1.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified.</p>\n<p>For HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. By setting the following connection header, the X-Forwarded-Host header can, for example, be removed:</p>\n<p>Connection: close, X-Forwarded-Host</p>\n<p>Depending on how the receiving application handles such cases, security implications may arise. Moreover, some application frameworks (e.g. Django) first transform the \"-\" to \"_\" signs, making it possible for the HTTP client to even modify these headers in these cases.</p>\n<p>This is similar to <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31813\">CVE-2022-31813</a> for Apache HTTP Server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>It was found that the following headers can be removed in this way (i.e. by specifing them within a connection header):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Host</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Port</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Proto</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Server</li>\n<li>X-Real-Ip</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert</li>\n<li>X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert-Info</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>The following docker-compose file has been used for a simple setup:</p>\n<pre><code>services:\n  traefik:\n    image: traefik:v3.1\n    container_name: traefik\n    ports:\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\n      - ./traefik.yaml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yaml\n      - ./traefik-certs:/certs\n\n  python-http:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    container_name: python-http\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.rule=Host(`python.example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.entrypoints=websecure\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.python-http.tls=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.services.python-http.loadbalancer.server.port=8080\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following traefik.yaml has been used:</p>\n<pre><code>providers:\n  docker:\n    exposedByDefault: false\n    watch: true\n  file:\n    fileName: /etc/traefik/traefik.yaml\n    watch: true\n\nentryPoints:\n  websecure:\n    address: \":443\"\n\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    - certFile: /certs/server-cert.pem\n      keyFile: /certs/server-key.pem\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Python container just includes a simple Python HTTP server that prints the HTTP headers it receives.

However, the documentation by gnark does not make clear that committing to private witnesses loses the zero-knowledge property. The documentation for <code>frontend.Committer</code> does not mention this, and the following snippet from <code>std/multicommit/doc_test.go</code>, where private witness variables are named <code>Secrets</code> and are committed, seems to actively suggest that committed witnesses are still private.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">// MultipleCommitmentCircuit is an example circuit showing usage of multiple\n// independent commitments in-circuit.\ntype MultipleCommitmentsCircuit struct {\n    Secrets [4]frontend.Variable\n}\n\nfunc (c *MultipleCommitmentsCircuit) Define(api frontend.API) error {\n    // first callback receives first unique commitment derived from the root commitment\n    multicommit.WithCommitment(api, func(api frontend.API, commitment frontend.Variable) error {\n        // compute (X-s[0]) * (X-s[1]) for a random X\n        res := api.Mul(api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[0]), api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[1]))\n        api.AssertIsDifferent(res, 0)\n        return nil\n    }, c.Secrets[:2]...)\n   // ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus it seems to me that the intention likely was (and users will be expecting) that gnark's implementation of Groth16 with these commitments should still have zero-knowledge and that the commitments should be hiding.</p>\n<p>The way to fix this is likely to adjust the commitment to be hiding the way that is done in the LegoSNARK paper (<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>). To expand:</p>\n<p>First, let me fix some notation.</p>\n<p>Currently, the verifying key has two points on G2 used for checking the proof of knowledge for the commitment: <code>g</code> and <code>g'=-1/σ * g</code> (in the code: <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.G</code> and <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.GRootSigmaNeg</code>).\nThe commitment itself is then <code>c = sum_i w_i * b_i</code>, where <code>b_i</code> are on G1, and the proof of knowledge associated to <code>c</code> is calculated as <code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i</code>, where <code>b'_i = σ*b_i</code> (in the code <code>b_i</code> and <code>b'_i</code> are <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.Basis[0][i]</code> and <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.BasisExpSigma[0][i]</code>). The proof of knowledge is then verified by checking <code>e(c, g) + e(pok, g') = 0</code> (I am using additive notation throughout here).</p>\n<p>The Groth16 proof is verified by checking</p>\n<pre><code>e(Krs, -[δ]₂) + e(c, -[γ]₂) + e(term involving public inputs, -[γ]₂) + other terms = 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The construction ccGro16 from the LegoSNARK paper (page 73 in <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>) is a similar construction. They do not have a proof of knowledge accompanying the commitment because they are considering the case where there are no public inputs. However, they claim that their scheme is zero-knowledge, and the crucial difference for this is that their commitment has an extra blinding term as is usual for Pedersen commitments. Concretely, it is of the form:</p>\n<pre><code>c_new = sum_i w_i * b_i + v*[η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/γ]₁</code> is a new element of G1 that is part of the proving key, with <code>η</code> a new toxic waste field element. The value of <code>v</code> is randomly chosen by the prover.</p>\n<p>When adding this additional term to <code>c</code>, then to make the proof verification still succeeds, the proof point <code>Krs</code> is changed accordingly:</p>\n<pre><code>Krs_new = Krs_old -  v*[η/δ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/δ]₁</code> is another new element of G1 that is part of the proving key. As <code>e([η/γ]₁, -[γ]₂) = e([η/δ]₁, -[δ]₂)</code>, the contributions from the new terms cancel each other in the proof verification pairing check.</p>\n<p>This modification should ensure that the commitment is hiding.</p>\n<p>The proof of knowledge would also need to be adapted accordingly, with</p>\n<pre><code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i + v*[σ*η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[σ*η/γ]₁</code> is another point of G1 to add to the proving key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments.
