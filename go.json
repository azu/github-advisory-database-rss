When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-affected\">Who is affected?</h3>\n<p>9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.</p>\n<p>We have notified the affected organizations where we have <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1224/contact-preferences/#setting-the-security-issues-email\">security contacts</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-impact\">What is the impact?</h3>\n<p>Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;</li>\n<li>Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and</li>\n<li>A non-interactive SSH session was used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"what-do-i-need-to-do\">What do I need to do?</h3>\n<p>If you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view <a href=\"https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines?q=version%3A%3C1.38.2+freebsd\">FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions</a> in the admin console.</p>\n<p>To update the local ports tree in advance of what's available upstream, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale</code></li>\n<li>edit the Makefile to set <code>PORTVERSION</code> to <code>1.38.2</code></li>\n<li><code>make makesum</code></li>\n<li><code>make install</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>We would like to thank <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbelgrave/\">Ryan Belgrave</a> for reporting this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins/#ts-2023-003\">TS-2023-003</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/security/advisories/GHSA-vfgq-g5x8-g595\">https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/security/advisories/GHSA-vfgq-g5x8-g595</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/commit/d00c046b723dff6e3775d7d35f891403ac21a47d\">https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/commit/d00c046b723dff6e3775d7d35f891403ac21a47d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/releases/tag/v1.38.2\">https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/releases/tag/v1.38.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins/#ts-2023-003\">https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins/#ts-2023-003</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfgq-g5x8-g595\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfgq-g5x8-g595</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This vulnerability exists because the MSI installer used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable directory.</p>\n<p>An attacker with local access to the device (without Administrator rights) can use symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in locations that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By creating a symlink from the world-writable directory to the target file, the attacker can manipulate the MSI installer's repair functionality to delete the target file during the repair process.</p>\n<p>Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete important system files or replace them with malicious files, potentially leading to the affected device being compromised.</p>\n<p><strong>The cloudflared client itself is not affected by this vulnerability, only the installer for 32-bit Windows devices.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>A new installer was released as part of version 2023.3.1, corresponding to pseudoversion 0.0.0-20230313153246-f686da832f85 on pkg.go.dev.

An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an <code>etcd</code> cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that <code>etcd</code> cluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This issue is patched in <code>cilium-cli</code> 0.13.2</p>\n<p>All previous versions of <code>cilium-cli</code> are affected. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Use Cilium's <a href=\"https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium\">Helm charts</a> to create your cluster instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations.
