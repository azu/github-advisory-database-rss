If they additionally have read and write permission to path in the repository, they can copy an otherwise unreadable object and read it.</p>\n<p>In order to be affected and exploitable, the following conditions must ALL occur on the same user:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>ci:ReadAction</code> enabled for the repository.  Predefined policies RepoManagementRead and RepoManagementFullAccess allow this action.</li>\n<li><code>fs:ReadObject</code> and <code>fs:WriteObject</code> enabled for some path.</li>\n<li><code>fs:ReadObject</code> <em>not</em> available for some path</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Such a user can use (1) to copy the unreadable object (3) to a path that they can read and write (2).
