The test shows that the go-tuf client inconsistently traces the delegations in a wrong way. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115#issuecomment-2275625542\">during one CI run</a>, the <code>two-level-delegations</code> test case triggered a wrong order.

The client should trace the delegations in the order <code>\"A\"</code> then <code>\"B\"</code> then <code>\"C\"</code> but in this particular CI run, go-tuf traced the delegations <code>\"B\"-&gt;\"C\"-&gt;\"A\"</code>.</p>\n<p>In a subsequent CI run, this test case did not fail, but <a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115#issuecomment-2275640487\">another one did</a>.</p>\n<p>@jku has done a bit of debugging and believes that the returned map of <code>GetRolesForTarget</code> returns a map that causes this behavior:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/blob/f95222bdd22d2ac4e5b8ed6fe912b645e213c3b5/metadata/metadata.go#L565-L580\">https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/blob/f95222bdd22d2ac4e5b8ed6fe912b645e213c3b5/metadata/metadata.go#L565-L580</a></p>\n<p>We believe that this map should be an ordered list instead of a map.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-4f8r-qqr9-fq8j\">https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-4f8r-qqr9-fq8j</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115\">https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/commit/f36420caba9edbfdfd64f95a9554c0836d9cf819\">https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/commit/f36420caba9edbfdfd64f95a9554c0836d9cf819</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/blob/f95222bdd22d2ac4e5b8ed6fe912b645e213c3b5/metadata/metadata.go#L565-L580\">https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/blob/f95222bdd22d2ac4e5b8ed6fe912b645e213c3b5/metadata/metadata.go#L565-L580</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47534\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47534</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f8r-qqr9-fq8j\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f8r-qqr9-fq8j</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

For example, downstream clusters which are alive while the main Rancher server is no longer available.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In some cases, Windows nodes added to RKE2 clusters may not be automatically updated with the desired <code>agent-tls-mode</code>. Windows clusters running at least the August patches (<code>v1.27.16</code>, <code>v1.28.13</code>, <code>v1.29.8</code>, <code>v1.30.4</code>) will be automatically updated. For Windows nodes running older versions of RKE2, this issue can be manually resolved by following these <a href=\"https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify\">instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are running Rancher <code>v2.7.x</code> Windows nodes will not automatically update, and you must follow the above <a href=\"https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify\">instructions</a>, with the following notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This needs to be done for all existing Windows nodes and any new nodes provisioned.</li>\n<li>You must omit the <code>DownloadWins</code> flag, and must instead manually download the <code>rancher-wins</code> version <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/wins/releases/tag/v0.4.18\">0.4.18</a>, or greater, from its GitHub repository and place it in the required directories:\na. <code>c:\\Windows</code>\nb. <code>c:\\user\\local\\bin</code></li>\n<li>You must restart the nodes after running the script, simply restarting <code>rancher-wins</code> or RKE2 will result in <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/5551\">pod networking errors</a>. The only scenario where you do not need to completely restart the node is if the cluster is running version <code>v1.27.16</code> or higher.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>This issue was found and reported by Jarkko Vesiluoma from Redtest Security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to the <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy\">SUSE Rancher Security team</a> for security related inquiries.</li>\n<li>Open an issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose\">Rancher</a> repository.</li>\n<li>Verify with our <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/\">support matrix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/\">product support lifecycle</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-9833-v2p4\">https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-9833-v2p4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify\">https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/tls-settings\">https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/tls-settings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-9833-v2p4\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-9833-v2p4</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
