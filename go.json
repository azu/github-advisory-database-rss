By default, the endpoint doesn't require authentication. It's possible to send a large, malicious request with headers (in this case \"X-GitHub-Event: push\") that will make ArgoCD start allocating memory to parse the incoming request. Since the request can be constructed client-side without allocating large amounts of memory, it can be arbitrarily large.
