In multi-tenancy deployments this can lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions.</p>\n<p>Within the affected versions, users with write access to a Flux source are able to use built-in features to expose sensitive data from the controller’s pod filesystem using a malicious <code>kustomization.yaml</code> file.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0 released on 2022-04-20. The changes introduce a new Kustomize file system implementation which ensures that all files being handled are contained within the Kustomization working directory, blocking references to any files that do not meet that requirement.</p>\n<p>Automated tooling (e.g. conftest) could be employed as a workaround, as part of a user's CI/CD pipeline to ensure that their <code>kustomization.yaml</code> files conform with specific policies, blocking access to sensitive path locations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw\">https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/commit/f4528fb25d611da94e491346bea056d5c5c3611f\">https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/commit/f4528fb25d611da94e491346bea056d5c5c3611f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fluxcd/pkg/commit/0ec014baf417fd3879d366a45503a548b9267d2a\">https://github.com/fluxcd/pkg/commit/0ec014baf417fd3879d366a45503a548b9267d2a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
