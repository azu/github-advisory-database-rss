In any case, that paper does not discuss any hiding/privacy/zero-knowledge properties of their protocols.</p>\n<p>So for the use-cases envisioned by that paper, having the commitment not be hiding and losing zero-knowledge of Groth16 might be adequate. However, the documentation by gnark does not make clear that committing to private witnesses loses the zero-knowledge property. The documentation for <code>frontend.Committer</code> does not mention this, and the following snippet from <code>std/multicommit/doc_test.go</code>, where private witness variables are named <code>Secrets</code> and are committed, seems to actively suggest that committed witnesses are still private.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">// MultipleCommitmentCircuit is an example circuit showing usage of multiple\n// independent commitments in-circuit.\ntype MultipleCommitmentsCircuit struct {\n    Secrets [4]frontend.Variable\n}\n\nfunc (c *MultipleCommitmentsCircuit) Define(api frontend.API) error {\n    // first callback receives first unique commitment derived from the root commitment\n    multicommit.WithCommitment(api, func(api frontend.API, commitment frontend.Variable) error {\n        // compute (X-s[0]) * (X-s[1]) for a random X\n        res := api.Mul(api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[0]), api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[1]))\n        api.AssertIsDifferent(res, 0)\n        return nil\n    }, c.Secrets[:2]...)\n   // ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus it seems to me that the intention likely was (and users will be expecting) that gnark's implementation of Groth16 with these commitments should still have zero-knowledge and that the commitments should be hiding.</p>\n<p>The way to fix this is likely to adjust the commitment to be hiding the way that is done in the LegoSNARK paper (<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>). To expand:</p>\n<p>First, let me fix some notation.</p>\n<p>Currently, the verifying key has two points on G2 used for checking the proof of knowledge for the commitment: <code>g</code> and <code>g'=-1/σ * g</code> (in the code: <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.G</code> and <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.GRootSigmaNeg</code>).\nThe commitment itself is then <code>c = sum_i w_i * b_i</code>, where <code>b_i</code> are on G1, and the proof of knowledge associated to <code>c</code> is calculated as <code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i</code>, where <code>b'_i = σ*b_i</code> (in the code <code>b_i</code> and <code>b'_i</code> are <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.Basis[0][i]</code> and <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.BasisExpSigma[0][i]</code>). The proof of knowledge is then verified by checking <code>e(c, g) + e(pok, g') = 0</code> (I am using additive notation throughout here).</p>\n<p>The Groth16 proof is verified by checking</p>\n<pre><code>e(Krs, -[δ]₂) + e(c, -[γ]₂) + e(term involving public inputs, -[γ]₂) + other terms = 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The construction ccGro16 from the LegoSNARK paper (page 73 in <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>) is a similar construction. They do not have a proof of knowledge accompanying the commitment because they are considering the case where there are no public inputs. However, they claim that their scheme is zero-knowledge, and the crucial difference for this is that their commitment has an extra blinding term as is usual for Pedersen commitments. Concretely, it is of the form:</p>\n<pre><code>c_new = sum_i w_i * b_i + v*[η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/γ]₁</code> is a new element of G1 that is part of the proving key, with <code>η</code> a new toxic waste field element. The value of <code>v</code> is randomly chosen by the prover.</p>\n<p>When adding this additional term to <code>c</code>, then to make the proof verification still succeeds, the proof point <code>Krs</code> is changed accordingly:</p>\n<pre><code>Krs_new = Krs_old -  v*[η/δ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/δ]₁</code> is another new element of G1 that is part of the proving key. As <code>e([η/γ]₁, -[γ]₂) = e([η/δ]₁, -[δ]₂)</code>, the contributions from the new terms cancel each other in the proof verification pairing check.</p>\n<p>This modification should ensure that the commitment is hiding.</p>\n<p>The proof of knowledge would also need to be adapted accordingly, with</p>\n<pre><code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i + v*[σ*η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[σ*η/γ]₁</code> is another point of G1 to add to the proving key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably, PLONK proofs are not affected.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small, then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed, then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices.</p>\n<p>It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245</a>.

To expand:</p>\n<p>First, let me fix some notation.</p>\n<p>Currently, the verifying key has two points on G2 used for checking the proof of knowledge for the commitment: <code>g</code> and <code>g'=-1/σ * g</code> (in the code: <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.G</code> and <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.GRootSigmaNeg</code>).\nThe commitment itself is then <code>c = sum_i w_i * b_i</code>, where <code>b_i</code> are on G1, and the proof of knowledge associated to <code>c</code> is calculated as <code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i</code>, where <code>b'_i = σ*b_i</code> (in the code <code>b_i</code> and <code>b'_i</code> are <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.Basis[0][i]</code> and <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.BasisExpSigma[0][i]</code>). The proof of knowledge is then verified by checking <code>e(c, g) + e(pok, g') = 0</code> (I am using additive notation throughout here).</p>\n<p>The Groth16 proof is verified by checking</p>\n<pre><code>e(Krs, -[δ]₂) + e(c, -[γ]₂) + e(term involving public inputs, -[γ]₂) + other terms = 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The construction ccGro16 from the LegoSNARK paper (page 73 in <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>) is a similar construction. They do not have a proof of knowledge accompanying the commitment because they are considering the case where there are no public inputs. However, they claim that their scheme is zero-knowledge, and the crucial difference for this is that their commitment has an extra blinding term as is usual for Pedersen commitments. Concretely, it is of the form:</p>\n<pre><code>c_new = sum_i w_i * b_i + v*[η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/γ]₁</code> is a new element of G1 that is part of the proving key, with <code>η</code> a new toxic waste field element. The value of <code>v</code> is randomly chosen by the prover.</p>\n<p>When adding this additional term to <code>c</code>, then to make the proof verification still succeeds, the proof point <code>Krs</code> is changed accordingly:</p>\n<pre><code>Krs_new = Krs_old -  v*[η/δ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[η/δ]₁</code> is another new element of G1 that is part of the proving key. As <code>e([η/γ]₁, -[γ]₂) = e([η/δ]₁, -[δ]₂)</code>, the contributions from the new terms cancel each other in the proof verification pairing check.</p>\n<p>This modification should ensure that the commitment is hiding.</p>\n<p>The proof of knowledge would also need to be adapted accordingly, with</p>\n<pre><code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i + v*[σ*η/γ]₁\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>[σ*η/γ]₁</code> is another point of G1 to add to the proving key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably, PLONK proofs are not affected.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small, then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed, then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices.</p>\n<p>It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245</a>.

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI). The user must have <code>applications, create</code> or <code>applications, update</code> RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error.</p>\n<p>The user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository. </p>\n<p>If the user has <code>repositories, update</code> access, they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access, they are probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>v2.6.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h4>\n<p>To mitigate the issue, make sure that your repo credentials have only least necessary privileges. For example, the credentials should not have push access, and they should not have access to more resources than what Argo CD actually needs (for example, a whole GitHub org when only one repo is needed).</p>\n<p>To further mitigate the impact of a leaked write-capable repo credential, you could <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/gpg-verification/#enforcing-signature-verification\">enable commit signature verification</a>. Even if someone could push a malicious commit, the commit would not by synced.</p>\n<p>You should also enforce least privileges in Argo CD RBAC. Make sure users only have <code>repositories, update</code>, <code>applications, update</code>, or <code>applications, create</code> access if they absolutely need it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The problem was initially reported in a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12309\">GitHub issue</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/\">Argo CD RBAC configuration documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues\">the Argo CD issue tracker</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions\">discussions</a></li>\n<li>Join us on <a href=\"https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack\">Slack</a> in channel #argo-cd</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-mv6w-j4xc-qpfw\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-mv6w-j4xc-qpfw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25163\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25163</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12309\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12309</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/12320\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/12320</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1548\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1548</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac\">https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mv6w-j4xc-qpfw\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mv6w-j4xc-qpfw</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
