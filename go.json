This vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension verification step.\nTo prevent this attack, go-libp2p now restricts RSA keys to &lt;= 8192 bits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Users should upgrade their go-libp2p versions to &gt;=v0.27.8, &gt;= v0.28.2, or &gt;=v0.29.1\nTo protect your application, it's necessary to update to these patch releases <strong>AND</strong> to use the updated Go compiler (1.20.7 or 1.19.12, respectively)</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There are no known workarounds</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>The Golang crypto/tls package also had this vulnerability (\"verifying certificate chains containing large RSA keys is slow” <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460\">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460</a>)\nFix in golang/go crypto/tls: <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017\">https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017</a>\nFix in quic-go <a href=\"https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012\">https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg\">https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39533\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39533</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460\">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/2454\">https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/2454</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012\">https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017\">https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/0cce607219f3710addc7e18672cffd1f1d912fbb\">https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/0cce607219f3710addc7e18672cffd1f1d912fbb</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/445be526aea4ee0b1fa5388aa65d32b2816d3a00\">https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/445be526aea4ee0b1fa5388aa65d32b2816d3a00</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/e30fcf7dfd4715ed89a5e68d7a4f774d3b9aa92d\">https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/e30fcf7dfd4715ed89a5e68d7a4f774d3b9aa92d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/61460\">https://go.dev/issue/61460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
