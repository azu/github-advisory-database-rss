The attacker can bypass the uniqueness check in (at least) the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>engineer a situation where the system administrator purges <code>/var/cache</code> ;</li>\n<li>target a system account <a href=\"https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/issues/547\">whose UID is in <code>authd</code>'s range</a> ;</li>\n<li>target an account which hasn't logged into a specific system in more than 6 months.\nNote that this isn't limited to inactive accounts <em>within the entire domain</em>, and impersonation on a given system can potentially be leveraged to compromise the target account on other systems; for example:<ul>\n<li>user <code>alice</code> is known to log into <code>1.example.com</code> ;</li>\n<li>the attacker computes a preimage (a username which yields the same UID), let's call it <code>bob</code> ;</li>\n<li>the attacker creates the account <code>bob</code> and logs into <code>2.example.com</code>, succeeding if alice hasn't (recently) logged into that system ;</li>\n<li>the attacker can now manipulate resources exposed on <code>2</code> as if they were alice; assuming <code>/home</code> is shared, they could manipulate <code>~alice/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, <code>~alice/.config</code>, alice's shell's initialization file, etc.\nNote: NFSv4's <code>idmap</code> mechanism may prevent this, but isn't enabled by default (unless Kerberos is used, which isn't the case in an <code>authd</code> deployment)</li>\n<li>at that point, gaining code execution as alice on <code>1.example.com</code> is usually trivial.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the necessary computation can be performed entirely offline, this wouldn't be affected by any rate-limits, and the only audit trail would be a single user registration. This would require on average less than 2³¹ computations of <code>GenerateID</code>: assuming SHA-256's cost is 25 cycles-per-byte, a clock speed of 3GHz, and short (≤32B) generated usernames, this is less than 10 minutes of a single core's time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h1>\n<p>The simplest and likely-best remediation path would be for the external IdP to provide a guaranteed-unique user ID in the correct range.\nIn OIDC, this is commonly communicated through a claim, though its name would need to be configurable as there's no real standard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CERN uses <code>cern_person_id</code>: <a href=\"https://auth.docs.cern.ch/user-documentation/oidc/config/\">https://auth.docs.cern.ch/user-documentation/oidc/config/</a> ;</li>\n<li>Okta, Zitadel, and many other IdPs, require the realm's administrator to define a custom attribute, conventionally called <code>uid</code> or <code>uidNumber</code> ;</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is also supported by other commonplace identity providers, such as LDAP and Active Directory:\n<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-uidNumber\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-uidNumber</a></p>\n<p>MS Entra presumably supports this as well.</p>\n<p>If that is not possible for some reason, architectural changes to authd would likely be required:\nassigning user IDs from a small space (such as Linux's 32b UIDs) requires mutable state to ensure uniqueness, whereas authd's design currently assumes no mutable state is held, aside from some transient, local cache.\nMoreover, that mutable state may need to be synchronised across multiple machines as uniform UIDs are often necessary, for instance when accessing a common networked filesystem.</p>\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1>\n<p>Thanks to Michael Gebetsroither for assisting with the writeup, and Jamie Bliss for the same as well as investigating when the issue was introduced in authd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/security/advisories/GHSA-4gfw-wf7c-w6g2\">https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/security/advisories/GHSA-4gfw-wf7c-w6g2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9312\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9312</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9312\">https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9312</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gfw-wf7c-w6g2\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gfw-wf7c-w6g2</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This\nlogic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). </p>\n<p>This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a \"standard\" Bitcoin\ntransaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block.</p>\n<h4 id=\"findanddelete-vs-removeopcodebydata\"><code>FindAndDelete</code> vs. <code>removeOpcodeByData</code></h4>\n<p><code>removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)</code> removes any data pushes from <code>script</code> that <em>contain</em> <code>dataToRemove</code>.
