This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads.  Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; <code>ExecSync</code> may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13.

What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>\n<p><strong>No</strong>. The http package is purely intended to be used for demonstration purposes. \nAnd bleve is never designed to be handling the RBACs or it was ever advertised to be used in that way. \nHence the collaborators of this project have decided to stay away from adding any authentication or \nauthorization to bleve project at the moment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>\n<p>The bleve/http package is mainly for demonstration purposes and it lacks exhaustive validation of the user \ninputs as well as any authentication and authorization measures. \nSo it is recommended to not use that in production use cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an issue <a href=\"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Email us at [mailto:<a href=\"mailto:security@couchbase.com\">security@couchbase.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:fts-team@couchbase.com\">fts-team@couchbase.com</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/security/advisories/GHSA-9w9f-6mg8-jp7w\">https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/security/advisories/GHSA-9w9f-6mg8-jp7w</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31022\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31022</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/commit/1c7509d6a17d36f265c90b4e8f4e3a3182fe79ff\">https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/commit/1c7509d6a17d36f265c90b4e8f4e3a3182fe79ff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9w9f-6mg8-jp7w\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9w9f-6mg8-jp7w</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
