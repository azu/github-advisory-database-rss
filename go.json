            "content_html": "<p>Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing, organizing and sharing application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder.&nbsp;The routine <code>untarFile</code> attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking <code>subdir/parent</code> to <code>..</code> (allowed, because <code>subdir/..</code> falls within the archive root) and then linking <code>subdir/parent/escapes</code> to <code>..</code> results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26312\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26312</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh/blob/master/pkg/archiver/tar.go#L255\">https://github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh/blob/master/pkg/archiver/tar.go#L255</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-254-zipslip-dotmesh\">https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-254-zipslip-dotmesh</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hf54-fq2m-p9v6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hf54-fq2m-p9v6</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>You can use a configuration like this in HAProxy:</p>\n<pre><code>listen w-send-proxy\n    mode tcp\n    log global\n    option tcplog\n    bind *:27654\n    tcp-request connection set-src ipv4(1.1.1.1)\n    server app1 ssh-piper-hostname:22 send-proxy\n</code></pre>\n<p>When connecting through HAProxy, sshpiper will log connections as originating from <code>1.1.1.1</code>.  The proxy protocol data is designed to survive multiple load balancers or proxies and pass through to sshpiper at the end, so it should only be enabled trusted environments. This should be behind a configuration option or startup flag to prevent abuse when public connections can be made to sshpiper.</p>\n<p>This is also backed up by <a href=\"https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt\">the specification for proxy protocol</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The receiver MUST be configured to only receive the protocol described in this\nspecification and MUST not try to guess whether the protocol header is present\nor not. This means that the protocol explicitly prevents port sharing between\npublic and private access. Otherwise it would open a major security breach by\nallowing untrusted parties to spoof their connection addresses. The receiver\nSHOULD ensure proper access filtering so that only trusted proxies are allowed\nto use this protocol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/security/advisories/GHSA-4w53-6jvp-gg52\">https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/security/advisories/GHSA-4w53-6jvp-gg52</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430\">https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/70fb830dca26bea7ced772ce5d834a3e88ae7f53\">https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/70fb830dca26bea7ced772ce5d834a3e88ae7f53</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w53-6jvp-gg52\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w53-6jvp-gg52</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
