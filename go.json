This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"detailed-description\">Detailed description</h3>\n<p>immudb uses Merkle Tree enhanced with additional linear part to perform consistency proofs between two transactions. The linear part is built from the last leaf node of the Merkle Tree compensating for transactions that were not yet consumed by the Merkle Tree calculation.</p>\n<p>The Merkle Tree part is then used to perform proofs for things that are in transaction range covered by the Merkle Tree where the linear part is used to check those that are not yet in the Merkle Tree.</p>\n<p>When doing consistency checks between two immudb states, the linear proof part is not fully checked. In fact only the first (last Merkle Tree leaf) and the last (current DB state value) are checked against new Merkle Tree without ensuring that elements in the middle of that chain are correctly added as Merkle Tree leafs.</p>\n<p>This lack of check means that the database can present different set of hashes on the linear proof part to what would later be used once those become part of the Merkle Tree.
