            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An issue was found in RKE2 where an attacker with network access to RKE2 servers' supervisor port (TCP 9345) can force the TLS server to add entries to the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list, through a stuffing attack, until the certificate grows so large that it exceeds the maximum size allowed by TLS client implementations. OpenSSL for example will raise an <code>excessive message size</code> error when this occurs. No authentication is necessary to perform this attack, only the ability to perform a TLS handshake against the supervisor port (TCP 9345).</p>\n<p>Affected servers will continue to operate, but clients (server or agent nodes) will fail to establish new connections when joining or rejoining the cluster, thus leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h3>\n<p>Upgrade to a fixed release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>v1.28.1+rke2r1</li>\n<li>v1.27.5+rke2r1</li>\n<li>v1.26.8+rke2r1</li>\n<li>v1.25.13+rke2r1</li>\n<li>1.24.17+rke2r1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are using RKE2 1.27 or earlier, you must also add the parameter <code>tls-san-security: true</code> to the RKE2 configuration to enable enhanced security for the supervisor's TLS SAN list. This option defaults to <code>true</code> starting with RKE2 1.28.</p>\n<p>Note that this flag changes the behavior of RKE2's supervisor listener. You should ensure that you configure <code>node-external-ip</code> on servers that will be connected to via an external IP, and add <code>tls-san</code> entries for any load-balancers or VIP addresses that will be associated with the supervisor port. External IPs and load-balancer/VIP addresses will no longer be added to the supervisor certificate's SAN list unless explicitly configured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigation\">Mitigation</h3>\n<p>If you cannot upgrade to a fixed release, the certificate can be \"frozen\" by running the following command against the cluster:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">kubectl annotate secret -n kube-system rke2-serving listener.cattle.io/static=true\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT CAUTION:</strong> Note that this mitigation will prevent the certificate from adding new SAN entries when servers join the cluster, and automatically renewing itself when it is about to expire. If you do this, you should delete the annotation when adding new servers to the cluster, or when the certificate is within 90 days of expiring, so that it can be updated. Once that is done, you can freeze it again.</p>\n<p>Affected certificates can be reset by performing the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run <code>kubectl delete secret -n kube-system rke2-serving</code></li>\n<li>Delete <code>/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/dynamic-cert.json</code> from all servers, and restart the <code>rke2-server</code> service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>The RKE2 supervisor listens on port TCP 9345 and uses the <code>rancher/dynamiclistener</code> library to dynamically generate TLS certificates that contain TLS Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for any host name or IP address requested by a client.
