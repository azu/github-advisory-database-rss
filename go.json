Basically this regex checks that the characters between the square braces are the only characters in the $request_uri header, if they exist, it returns a HTTP 401 status code.

Under close evaluation the score we originally assigned to this CVE is inappropriate in two clearly identifiable criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complexity (Low -&gt; High): This attack requires the administrator be using NGINX's auth_request module. This means the attack cannot be exploited at will but rather requires a pre-condition separate to the vulnerable system outside of the attackers control (a vulnerable version of NGINX - at the time of this writing NGINX's security team has <em>refused</em> to fix the clear bug on their end but that's effectively irrelevant since we operate with more than just a NGINX proxy and no other proxy has this vulnerability), and requires the attacker have gathered knowledge about the system for this likely to be exploited.</li>\n<li>Availability (High -&gt; None): This attack does not alter availability directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/advisories/GHSA-68wm-pfjf-wqp6\">https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/advisories/GHSA-68wm-pfjf-wqp6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32637\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32637</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/authelia/authelia/commit/c62dbd43d6e69ae81530e7c4f8763857f8ff1dda\">https://github.com/authelia/authelia/commit/c62dbd43d6e69ae81530e7c4f8763857f8ff1dda</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68wm-pfjf-wqp6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68wm-pfjf-wqp6</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

Because of this direct access, with IPv6 enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses.</li>\n<li>If router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses.</li>\n<li>The interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface.</p>\n<p>A container with an unexpected IPv6 address can do anything a container configured with an IPv6 address can do. That is, listen for connections on its IPv6 address, open connections to other nodes on the network over IPv6, or attempt a DoS attack by flooding packets from its IPv6 address. This has CVSS score AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L (2.7).</p>\n<p>Because the container may not be constrained by an IPv6 firewall, there is increased potential for data exfiltration from the container. This has CVSS score AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (4.7).</p>\n<p>A remote attacker could send malicious Router Advertisements to divert traffic to itself, a black-hole, or another device. The same attack is possible today for IPv4 macvlan/ipvlan endpoints with ARP spoofing, TLS is commonly used by Internet APIs to mitigate this risk. The presence of an IPv6 route could impact the container's availability by indirectly abusing the behaviour of software which behaves poorly in a dual-stack environment. For example, it could resolve a name to a DNS AAAA record and keep trying to connect over IPv6 without ever falling back to IPv4, potentially denying service to the container. This has CVSS score AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (4.5).</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The issue is patched in 26.0.2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use <code>--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1</code> in the <code>docker create</code> or <code>docker run</code> command.

This allows a malicious actor to perform EVM transactions that do not meet the checks performed under <code>newEthAnteHandler</code>. This opens the possibility for the DOS of validators and consequently halt the chain through an infinite EVM execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-details\">Additional details</h3>\n<p>The attack scenario is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The attacker deploys a simple smart contract with an infinite loop to the chain.  </li>\n<li>The attacker calls the smart contract using an embedded transaction with an extremely high gas value (<code>uint64</code> max or similar). </li>\n<li>Once the transaction is included in a block, nodes will try to execute the EVM transaction with almost infinite gas and get stuck. <strong>This stops new block creation and effectively halts the chain, requiring a manual restart of all nodes.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"users-impacted\">Users Impacted</h2>\n<p>All Evmos users are impacted by this vulnerability as it has the potential to halt the chain.

It also covers the scenario in which <code>MsgEthereumTx</code> are deeply nested by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doing a recursive check over the nested messages of <code>MsgExec</code></li>\n<li>Limiting the amount of possible nested messages (inner messages) in <code>MsgExec</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is done by adding an additional <code>AnteHandler</code> decorator (<code>AuthzLimiterDecorator</code>) for Cosmos and EIP-712 transactions.</p>\n<p>This is a state machine-breaking change as it restricts previously allowed messages and thus requires a hard-fork upgrade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p><strong>Are there any links users can visit to find out more?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to the Core Team in <a href=\"https://discord.gg/evmos\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Open a discussion in <a href=\"https://github.com/evmos/evmos/discussions\">evmos/evmos</a></li>\n<li>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:security@evmos.org\">security@evmos.org</a> for security questions</li>\n<li>For Press, email us at <a href=\"mailto:evmos@west-comms.com\">evmos@west-comms.com</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-v6rw-hhgg-wc4x\">https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-v6rw-hhgg-wc4x</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6rw-hhgg-wc4x\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6rw-hhgg-wc4x</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
