The vulnerability can potentially be used to access files and directories on the host system.  The full scope of impact is exactly unknown, but reading files outside of a server's base directory (sandbox root) is possible.</p>\n<p>In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings.  Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until March 27th, 2024 at 18:00 UTC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resolution\">Resolution</h3>\n<p>In order to mitigate this vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server filesystem was necessary.  Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however effort was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes.  While tests were written to ensure security and functionality, there may be some semantic differences of certain operations, such as different errors being returned for example.  If you notice any major semantic differences, please open an issue on our issue tracker so it can be resolved. <a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/new/choose\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/new/choose</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability has been resolved in version <code>v1.11.9</code> of Wings.</p>\n<p>Everyone should update to Wings <code>v1.11.9</code> (or newer).</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27102\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27102</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the \"no commands\" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking.</p>\n<p>Given by the following substitution examples:\nusing <code>parameters</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">steps:\n  - name: example\n    image: &lt;some plugin&gt;\n    secrets: [ example_secret ]\n    parameters:\n      example: $${EXAMPLE_SECRET}\n</code></pre>\n<p>using <code>image</code> tag</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">steps:\n  - name: example\n    image: &lt;some plugin&gt;:latest${EXAMPLE_SECRET}\n    secrets: [ example_secret ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>using <code>entrypoint</code> as a shim for <code>commands</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">steps:\n  - name: example\n    image: &lt;some plugin&gt;\n    secrets: [ example_secret ]\n    entrypoint:\n      [\n        \"sh\",\n        \"-c\",\n        \"echo $EXAMPLE_SECRET\",\n      ]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>To exploit this</strong> the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive.</p>\n<p>While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the \"no commands\" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in <code>parameters</code> that are not intended to be used for sensitive values.</li>\n<li>Ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive.</li>\n<li>Minimize secrets with <code>pull_request</code> events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process.</li>\n<li>Make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users</li>\n<li>Limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/go-vela/worker\">https://github.com/go-vela/worker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:vela@target.com\">vela@target.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Affected products: <code>go-vela/worker</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h\">https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28236\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28236</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297\">https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

If your chain utilizes the <code>ValidateVoteExtensions</code> helper in <code>ProcessProposal</code>, a dishonest proposer can potentially mutate voting power of each validator it includes in the injected <code>VoteExtension</code>, which could have potentially unexpected or negative consequences on modified state.  Additional validation on injected <code>VoteExtension</code> data was added to confirm voting power against the state machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps-for-impacted-parties\">Next Steps for Impacted Parties</h2>\n<p>If you are a chain developer on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.

This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>2.x versions are fixed on &gt;= <a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.46.0\">2.46.0</a>\n2.45.x versions are fixed on &gt;= <a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.45.1\">2.45.1</a>\n2.44.x versions are fixed on &gt;= <a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.44.3\">2.44.3</a></p>\n<p>ZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.</p>\n<p>Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your ZITADEL instance (e.g. within your WAF): <code>__Secure-zitadel-useragent</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>None</p>\n<h3 id=\"questions\">Questions</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:security@zitadel.com\">security@zitadel.com</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Amit Laish – GE Vernova for finding and reporting the vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr\">https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/d4c553b75a214e41299af010ef4b26174a0f802c\">https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/d4c553b75a214e41299af010ef4b26174a0f802c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/e82cb51eb819c6cdba8123c9c34c5739b46b29eb\">https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/e82cb51eb819c6cdba8123c9c34c5739b46b29eb</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28197\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28197</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
