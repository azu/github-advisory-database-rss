The repo-server is a critical component of Argo CD, so crashing the repo-server effectively denies core Argo CD services (such as syncing Application updates).</p>\n<p>To achieve denial of service, the attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. </p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>v2.4.1</li>\n<li>v2.3.5</li>\n<li>v2.2.10</li>\n<li>v2.1.16</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The patch introduces a new <code>reposerver.max.combined.directory.manifests.size</code> config parameter, which you should tune before upgrading in production.</strong> It caps the maximum total file size of .yaml/.yml/.json files in directory-type (raw manifest) Applications. The default max is <code>10M</code> per Application. This max is designed to keep any single app from consuming more than 3G of memory in the repo-server (manifests consume more space in memory than on disk). The 300x ratio assumes a maliciously-crafted manifest file. If you only want to protect against accidental excessive memory use, it is probably safe to use a smaller ratio.</p>\n<p>If your organization uses directory-type Applications with very many manifests or very large manifests then <strong>check the size of those manifests and tune the config parameter before deploying this change to production</strong>. When testing, make sure to do a \"hard refresh\" in either the CLI or UI to test your directory-type App. That will make sure you're using the new max logic instead of relying on cached manifest responses from Redis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There is no workaround besides upgrading.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the issue, carefully limit 1) who can configure repos (determined by <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/\">RBAC</a>), 2) which repos are allowed (determined by <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/\">Project</a> limitations), and 3) who has push access to those repos (determined by your SCM provider configuration).</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Disclosed by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.
