This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigation\">Mitigation</h3>\n<p>The maximum compression ratio achievable with <code>deflate</code> is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process it <em>may</em> be possible to help Go's garbage collector \"keep up\".</p>\n<p>Implementors are encouraged not to rely on this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This issue is addressed in v0.9.0</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-6gc3-crp7-25w5\">https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-6gc3-crp7-25w5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/commit/f9d66040241093e8702649baff50cc70d2c683c0\">https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/commit/f9d66040241093e8702649baff50cc70d2c683c0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/releases/tag/v0.9.0\">https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/releases/tag/v0.9.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6gc3-crp7-25w5\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6gc3-crp7-25w5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1602\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1602</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26483\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26483</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The vulnerability was possible due to  React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. later, an another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on \"Markdown\" or \"HTML\" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.   </p>\n<h3 id=\"impacted-versions\">Impacted versions</h3>\n<p>Grafana versions between 9.2.0 and 9.2.10. and between 9.3.0 and 9.3.4</p>\n<h3 id=\"solutions-and-mitigations\">Solutions and mitigations</h3>\n<p>Update your Grafana instance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-security-issues\">Reporting security issues</h2>\n<p>If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to <a href=\"mailto:security@grafana.com\">security@grafana.com</a>.
