As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection.

The Meshery project exposes the function <code>GetMeshSyncResourcesKinds</code> at the API URL <code>/api/system/meshsync/resources/kinds</code>. The order query parameter is directly used to build a SQL query in <code>meshync_handler.go</code>. Version 0.7.22 fixes this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35181\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35181</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/10207\">https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/10207</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/10280\">https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/10280</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/commit/8e995ce21af02d32ef61689c1e1748a745917f13\">https://github.com/meshery/meshery/commit/8e995ce21af02d32ef61689c1e1748a745917f13</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/commit/b55f6064d0c6a965aee38f30281f99da7dc4420c\">https://github.com/meshery/meshery/commit/b55f6064d0c6a965aee38f30281f99da7dc4420c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/b331f45c9083d7abf6b90105072b04cd22473de7/server/handlers/meshsync_handler.go#L187\">https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/b331f45c9083d7abf6b90105072b04cd22473de7/server/handlers/meshsync_handler.go#L187</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-013_GHSL-2024-014_Meshery\">https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-013_GHSL-2024-014_Meshery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9f24-jrv4-f8g5\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9f24-jrv4-f8g5</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
