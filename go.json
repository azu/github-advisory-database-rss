This vulnerability, CVE-2023-1299, was introduced in Nomad 1.5.0 and fixed in Nomad 1.5.1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>Nomad 1.4.0 introduced the concept of workload identity so that tasks can access variables without needing to access them through Nomad HTTP API with an ACL token.</p>\n<p>In 1.5.0, the identity block was introduced, which exposes the workload identity token to the workload so it can access Nomad HTTP API via a unix domain socket without configuring mTLS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>During internal testing, we discovered it was possible to abuse the workload identity to elevate to management-level privilege if the workload identity did not have any attached ACL policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h3>\n<p>Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Nomad 1.5.1 or newer. See Nomad’s Upgrading for general guidance on this process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1299\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1299</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-08-nomad-job-submitter-privilege-escalation-using-workload-identity/51389\">https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-08-nomad-job-submitter-privilege-escalation-using-workload-identity/51389</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rqm8-q8j9-662f\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rqm8-q8j9-662f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, that slice's size will be increased to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workaround\">Workaround</h3>\n<p>Users can restrict write privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-v829-x6hh-cqfq\">https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-v829-x6hh-cqfq</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27484\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27484</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v829-x6hh-cqfq\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v829-x6hh-cqfq</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
