        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ProxyScotch is a simple proxy server created for hoppscotch.io. The package github.com/hoppscotch/proxyscotch before 1.0.0 are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) when interceptor mode is set to proxy. It occurs when an HTTP request is made by a backend server to an untrusted URL submitted by a user. It leads to a leakage of sensitive information from the server.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0 released on 2022-04-20.

This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry.

This action gives the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.</p>

<p>This vulnerability affects customers who utilize non-admin users that are able to create or edit <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/">Global Roles</a>. The most common use case for this scenario is the <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin"><code>restricted-admin</code></a> role.</p>
<p>A flaw was discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3 which allows users who have create or update permissions on Global Roles to escalate their permissions, or those of another user, to admin-level permissions. Global Roles grant users Rancher-wide permissions, such as the ability to create clusters. In the identified versions of Rancher, when users are given permission to edit or create Global Roles, they are not restricted to only granting permissions which they already posses.</p>
<p>The privilege escalation can be taken advantage of in two ways by users with create or update permissions on Global Roles (including the <code>restricted-admin</code>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Editing the global <code>admin</code> role to make it the default for new users, then creating a new user that will be elevated to the global <code>admin</code> role.</li>
<li>Creating a new global role with permissions already possessed by the <code>restricted-admin</code>, assigning this new role to a user, then modifying the global role to grant additional administrive like permissions (<code>'*'</code>) to the elevated user.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Patched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have users who have create or edit permissions on Global Roles but are not admin users (for example, the <code>restricted-admin</code>), it is highly advised to review the roles and users created by those users for possible privilege escalations.</p>

<p>This issue only happens when the user configures access credentials to a private repository in Rancher inside <code>Apps &amp; Marketplace &gt; Repositories</code>. It affects Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.11 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.2.</p>
<p>An insufficient check of the same-origin policy when downloading Helm charts from a configured private repository can lead to exposure of the repository credentials to a third-party provider. This exposure happens when the private repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does an HTTP redirect to a third-party repository or external storage provider.</li>
<li>Downloads an icon resource for the chart hosted on a third-party provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>The address of the private repository is not leaked, only the credentials are leaked in the HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header in base64 format.</p>
<p>With the patched versions, the default behavior now is to only send the private repository credentials when subdomain or domain hostname match when following the redirect or downloading external resources.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Patched versions include releases 2.5.12, 2.6.3 and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<ol>
<li>Update Rancher to a patched version.</li>
<li>Check the Helm charts in your configured private repository for possible redirects to third-party storage, and for Helm chart icons from third-party sources.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability only affects customers using the <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin"><code>restricted-admin</code></a> role in Rancher. For this role to be active, Rancher must be bootstrapped with the environment variable <code>CATTLE_RESTRICTED_DEFAULT_ADMIN=true</code> or the configuration flag <code>restrictedAdmin=true</code>.</p>
<p>A flaw was discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3 where the <code>global-data</code> role in <code>cattle-global-data</code> namespace grants write access to the Catalogs. Since each user with any level of catalog access was bound to the <code>global-data</code> role, this grants write access to templates (<code>CatalogTemplates</code>) and template versions (<code>CatalogTemplateVersions</code>) for any user with any level of catalog access. New users created in Rancher are by default assigned to the <code>user</code> role (standard user), which is not designed to grant write catalog access. This vulnerability effectively elevates the privilege of any user to write access for the catalog template and catalog template version resources.</p>
<p>A malicious user could abuse this vulnerability to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make applications or individual versions of applications visible or hidden on the UI, by modifying <code>version</code> and <code>rancherMaxVersion</code> fields.</li>
<li>Change the logo (field <code>icon</code>) of an application or template to an arbitrary image.</li>
<li>Make a chart appear as a trusted or partner chart. This can be abused to make less trusted charts, such as customer defined charts, appear more legitimate than they are, by adding the label <code>io.rancher.certified: partner</code>.</li>
<li>Swap template versions between templates of charts inside the same catalog. This can be exploited to swap the files from one chart or version to another, by changing <code>versionDir</code> field. When a user on the target cluster deploys their chart, it will deploy the modified version.</li>
</ol>
<p>This vulnerability does not allow to modify the base64 encoded <code>files</code> fields of the <code>templateVersions</code>, so one cannot inject arbitrary data to charts that have already been pulled from their respective catalog.</p>
<p>Without access to the Catalog, malicious users are limited to injecting apps which already exist in a registered catalog. They would need write access to the catalog or external write access to a source repo to inject arbitrary code.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Patched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the <code>restricted-admin</code> as the default admin role in your environment, it's highly advised to review <code>CatalogTemplates</code> and <code>CatalogTemplateVersions</code> for possible malicious modifications.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability only affects customers using Fleet for continuous delivery with authenticated Git and/or Helm repositories.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29810">CVE-2022-29810</a>) was discovered in <code>go-getter</code> library in versions prior to <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/releases/tag/v1.5.11"><code>v1.5.11</code></a> that exposes SSH private keys in base64 format due to a failure in redacting such information from error messages. The vulnerable version of this library is used in Rancher through Fleet in versions of Fleet prior to <a href="https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/tag/v0.3.9"><code>v0.3.9</code></a>. This issue affects Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3.</p>
<p>When Git and/or Helm authentication is configured in <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/deploy-across-clusters/fleet/">Fleet</a> and Fleet is used to deploy a git repo through <code>Continuous Delivery</code>, the affected <code>go-getter</code> version will expose the configured SSH private key secret if Fleet fails to download the git repo due to a misconfigured URL. The exposed SSH key is logged in base64 format as a query parameter together with the git URL. The credentials can be seen in Rancher UI and in Fleet's deployment pod logs.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Patched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions. Until you are able to upgrade, limit access in Rancher to trusted users and carefully validate the URLs you are using are correct. Please note that the SSH key might still be compromised in valid URLs if the service goes down or a connection error happens when pulling from the repos.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you believe that SSH keys might have been exposed in your environment, it's highly advised to rotate them.</p>
