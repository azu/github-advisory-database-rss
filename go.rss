<p>A vulnerability has been identified which enables <a href="https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions">Standard users</a> or above to elevate their permissions to Administrator in the <code>local</code> cluster.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> cluster means the cluster where Rancher is installed. It is named <code>local</code> inside the list of clusters in the Rancher UI.</p>
<p>Standard users could leverage their existing permissions to manipulate Kubernetes secrets in the <code>local</code> cluster, resulting in the secret being deleted, but their read-level permissions to the secret being preserved. When this operation was followed-up by other specially crafted commands, it could result in the user gaining access to tokens belonging to service accounts in the <code>local</code> cluster.</p>
<p>Users that have custom global roles which grant <code>create</code> and <code>delete</code> permissions on <code>secrets</code> would also be able to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Users with <a href="https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log#enabling-api-audit-log">audit logs enabled</a> in Rancher can try to identify possible abuses of this issue by going through the logs. To sieve through the data filter by <code>kind: Secret</code> with <code>type: provisioning.cattle.io/cloud-credential</code>, then investigate all log entries that affect that specific resource. A secondary check would be to filter by all operations with <code>Opaque</code> Secrets within the <code>cattle-global-data</code> namespace.</p>
<p>After patching, it is recommended that users review access methods to Rancher (including RBAC policies, tokens, and host-level node access), to ensure that no changes were made to persist access to users who have leveraged this vulnerability.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in the Rancher UI. 
Cross-Site scripting allows a malicious user to inject code that is executed within another user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate web content, or perform other malicious activities on behalf of the victims. This could result in a user with write access to the affected areas being able to act on behalf of an administrator, once an administrator opens the affected web page.</p>
<p>The affected areas include the Projects/Namespaces and Auth Provider sections. The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write access to those features in order to exploit the vulnerabilities. Some of the permissions (roles) required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Owner.</li>
<li>Restricted Admin.</li>
<li>Configure Authentication.</li>
<li>Administrator.</li>
<li>Custom RBAC Role that provides write access on Projects or External Authentication Providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For users that suspect this vulnerability may have targeted their Rancher instance, we recommend rotating all API Keys and Kubeconfig tokens.</p>
<p>It's also advised to review logs and possibly rotate credentials stored as secrets in Rancher and downstream cluster, if you believe that users' credentials to access Rancher and its clusters might have been compromised.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI). The user must have <code>applications, create</code> or <code>applications, update</code> RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error.</p>
<p>The user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository. </p>
<p>If the user has <code>repositories, update</code> access, they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access, they are probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD version:</p>
<ul>
<li>v2.6.1</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.</p>
<h4 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h4>
<p>To mitigate the issue, make sure that your repo credentials have only least necessary privileges. For example, the credentials should not have push access, and they should not have access to more resources than what Argo CD actually needs (for example, a whole GitHub org when only one repo is needed).</p>
<p>To further mitigate the impact of a leaked write-capable repo credential, you could <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/gpg-verification/#enforcing-signature-verification">enable commit signature verification</a>. Even if someone could push a malicious commit, the commit would not by synced.</p>
<p>You should also enforce least privileges in Argo CD RBAC. Make sure users only have <code>repositories, update</code>, <code>applications, update</code>, or <code>applications, create</code> access if they absolutely need it.</p>

<p>The external-secrets has a deployment called default-external-secrets-cert-controller, which is bound with a same-name ClusterRole. This ClusterRole has "get/list" verbs of secrets resources(<a href="https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L49">https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L49</a>). It also has path/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations resources(<a href="https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L27">https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L27</a>). As a result, if a malicious user can access the worker node which has this deployment. he/she can:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For the "get/list secrets" permission, he/she can abuse the SA token of this deployment to retrieve or get ALL secrets in the whole cluster, including the cluster-admin secret if created. After that, he/she can abuse the cluster-admin secret to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the patch/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations, the malicious user can abuse these permissions to get sensitive data or lanuch DoS attacks:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the privilege escalation attack, by updating/patching a Webhook to make it listen to Secret update operations, the attacker can capture and log all data from requests attempting to update Secrets. More specifically, when a Secret is updated, this Webhook sends the request data to the logging-service, which can then log the content of the Secret. This way, an attacker could indirectly gain access to the full contents of the Secret.</p>
<p>For the DoS attack, by updating/patching a Webhook, and making it deny all Pod create and update requests, the attacker can prevent any new Pods from being created or existing Pods from being updated, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The current cryptography implementation in Sliver up to version 1.5.39 allows a MitM with access to the corresponding implant binary to execute arbitrary codes on implanted devices via intercepted and crafted responses. (Reserved CVE ID: CVE-2023-34758)</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/tangent65536/Slivjacker">the PoC repo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>Please also see <a href="https://github.com/tangent65536/Slivjacker">the PoC repo</a>.
To setup a simple PoC environment,  </p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an implant with its C2 set to the PoC server's address and copy the embedded private implant key and public server key into the config json.  </li>
<li>Run the implant on a separate VM and a <code>notepad.exe</code> window should pop up on the implanted VM.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A successful attack grants the attacker permission to execute arbitrary code on the implanted device.  </p>

This allows an adversary who controls a subdomain to set the value of the cookie on the Gitpod control plane, which can be assigned to an attacker’s own JWT so that specific actions taken by the victim (such as connecting a new Github organization) are actioned by the attackers session.</p>
