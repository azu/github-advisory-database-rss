<p><strong>Component</strong>: CometBFT
<strong>Criticality:</strong> Low
<strong>Affected versions:</strong> All
<strong>Affected users:</strong> Validators, Chain Builders + Maintainers</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>A default configuration in CometBFT has been found to be large for common use cases, and may affect block times and consensus participation when fully utilized by chain participants. It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the <code>BlockParams.MaxBytes</code> consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the <code>timeout_propose</code> parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a networkâ€™s topography.</p>
<p>When setting a large <code>BlockParams.MaxBytes</code>, there are two main implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased bandwidth to propagate a block</li>
<li>Increased latency to propagate a block</li>
</ul>
<p>When combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.&nbsp; The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for <code>BlockParams.MaxBytes</code>, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block.&nbsp;CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.</p>
<h1 id="considerations">Considerations</h1>
<p>CometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.</p>
<h1 id="next-steps-for-chains-and-validators">Next Steps for Chains and Validators</h1>
<p>To increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (<a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405">https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405</a>, <a href="https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes">v0.34.x</a>, <a href="https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes">v0.37.x</a>, <a href="https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes">v0.38.x</a>) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a <code>BlockParams.MaxBytes</code> configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning <code>BlockParams</code> may require a network upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the <code>BlockParams.MaxBytes</code> limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (<a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408">https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408</a>), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks. These code changes will be included in the <em>next</em> release of each branch of CometBFT.</p>
<p>As more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note from Amulet on the Security Advisory Process:</p>
<p>In the interest of timely resolution of this issue for validators and node operators, the Amulet team has chosen to use existing processes and resources for distributing security advisories within the Cosmos and Interchain Ecosystems. Stay tuned as we implement an improved, more robust security advisory distribution system that will provide equitable access to information about security issues in the Interchain Stack.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>DELETE /api/snapshots/{key}</strong></em> endpoint allows any Grafana user to delete snapshots if the user is NOT in the organization of the snapshot</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>An attacker (a user without organization affiliation or with a "no basic role" in an organization other than the one where the dashboard exists), knowing the key or URL of a snapshot created by any user (including Grafana admins), can delete a snapshot (It is not feasible using UI), resulting in a BOLA vulnerability. 
If an attacker is in the same organization of the dashboard snapshot, he canâ€™t delete the snapshot. However, an attacker with low-privilege from a different organization would be able to delete it, resulting in the authorization flaw. </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 3 50 23â€¯PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58054904/298194695-bea8ab57-8504-4f5d-9468-cef7acf8622b.png"></p>
<h3 id="precondition">Precondition</h3>
<p>To exploit this endpoint, an attacker must know the {key} of a snapshot. The attacker can potentially discover this key in various ways.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/snapshot/">creating a snapshot through the API</a>, users can manually specify a key without any complexity requirements. This lack of complexity makes this key susceptible to brute force attacks. For example, simplistic keys such as "customer_key_123" or "admin_snap" can be easily guessed. These predictable keys allow low-privileged attackers to perform brute-force attacks using common keywords, potentially leading to compromised data integrity.</p>
<p>In addition, this key is displayed in plain text in the URL of a snapshot. This means that if a user publicly displays a snapshot, viewers might note down the key. Furthermore, since the snapshot feature is often used for sharing, displaying, and backing up data, a low-privileged attacker could potentially find snapshot keys in places like the organization's content management system, messaging platform, or shared documents.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>DELETE /api/snapshots/{key}</strong></em> endpoint allows any Grafana user to delete snapshots if the user is NOT in the organization of the snapshot</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>An attacker (a user without organization affiliation or with a "no basic role" in an organization other than the one where the dashboard exists), knowing the key or URL of a snapshot created by any user (including Grafana admins), can delete a snapshot (It is not feasible using UI), resulting in a BOLA vulnerability. 
If an attacker is in the same organization of the dashboard snapshot, he canâ€™t delete the snapshot. However, an attacker with low-privilege from a different organization would be able to delete it, resulting in the authorization flaw. </p>

<h3 id="precondition">Precondition</h3>
<p>To exploit this endpoint, an attacker must know the {key} of a snapshot. The attacker can potentially discover this key in various ways.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/snapshot/">creating a snapshot through the API</a>, users can manually specify a key without any complexity requirements. This lack of complexity makes this key susceptible to brute force attacks. For example, simplistic keys such as "customer_key_123" or "admin_snap" can be easily guessed. These predictable keys allow low-privileged attackers to perform brute-force attacks using common keywords, potentially leading to compromised data integrity.</p>
<p>In addition, this key is displayed in plain text in the URL of a snapshot. This means that if a user publicly displays a snapshot, viewers might note down the key. Furthermore, since the snapshot feature is often used for sharing, displaying, and backing up data, a low-privileged attacker could potentially find snapshot keys in places like the organization's content management system, messaging platform, or shared documents.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>DELETE /api/snapshots/{key}</strong></em> endpoint allows any Grafana user to delete snapshots if the user is NOT in the organization of the snapshot</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>An attacker (a user without organization affiliation or with a "no basic role" in an organization other than the one where the dashboard exists), knowing the key or URL of a snapshot created by any user (including Grafana admins), can delete a snapshot (It is not feasible using UI), resulting in a BOLA vulnerability. 
If an attacker is in the same organization of the dashboard snapshot, he canâ€™t delete the snapshot. However, an attacker with low-privilege from a different organization would be able to delete it, resulting in the authorization flaw. </p>

<h3 id="precondition">Precondition</h3>
<p>To exploit this endpoint, an attacker must know the {key} of a snapshot. The attacker can potentially discover this key in various ways.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/snapshot/">creating a snapshot through the API</a>, users can manually specify a key without any complexity requirements. This lack of complexity makes this key susceptible to brute force attacks. For example, simplistic keys such as "customer_key_123" or "admin_snap" can be easily guessed. These predictable keys allow low-privileged attackers to perform brute-force attacks using common keywords, potentially leading to compromised data integrity.</p>
<p>In addition, this key is displayed in plain text in the URL of a snapshot. This means that if a user publicly displays a snapshot, viewers might note down the key. Furthermore, since the snapshot feature is often used for sharing, displaying, and backing up data, a low-privileged attacker could potentially find snapshot keys in places like the organization's content management system, messaging platform, or shared documents.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>DELETE /api/snapshots/{key}</strong></em> endpoint allows any Grafana user to delete snapshots if the user is NOT in the organization of the snapshot</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>An attacker (a user without organization affiliation or with a "no basic role" in an organization other than the one where the dashboard exists), knowing the key or URL of a snapshot created by any user (including Grafana admins), can delete a snapshot (It is not feasible using UI), resulting in a BOLA vulnerability. 
If an attacker is in the same organization of the dashboard snapshot, he canâ€™t delete the snapshot. However, an attacker with low-privilege from a different organization would be able to delete it, resulting in the authorization flaw. </p>

<h3 id="precondition">Precondition</h3>
<p>To exploit this endpoint, an attacker must know the {key} of a snapshot. The attacker can potentially discover this key in various ways.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/snapshot/">creating a snapshot through the API</a>, users can manually specify a key without any complexity requirements. This lack of complexity makes this key susceptible to brute force attacks. For example, simplistic keys such as "customer_key_123" or "admin_snap" can be easily guessed. These predictable keys allow low-privileged attackers to perform brute-force attacks using common keywords, potentially leading to compromised data integrity.</p>
<p>In addition, this key is displayed in plain text in the URL of a snapshot. This means that if a user publicly displays a snapshot, viewers might note down the key. Furthermore, since the snapshot feature is often used for sharing, displaying, and backing up data, a low-privileged attacker could potentially find snapshot keys in places like the organization's content management system, messaging platform, or shared documents.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name</strong>: ASA-2024-007: Potential Reentrancy using Timeout Callbacks in ibc-hooks
<strong>Component</strong>: ibc-go
<strong>Criticality</strong>: Critical (<a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1</a>: I:Critical; L:AlmostCertain)
<strong>Affected versions</strong>: &lt; v4.6.0, &lt; v5.4.0, &lt; v6.3.0, &lt; v7.4.0, &lt; v8.2.0
<strong>Affected users</strong>: Chain Builders + Maintainers</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Through the deployment and subsequent use of a malicious CosmWasm contract via IBC interactions, an attacker could potentially execute the same <code>MsgTimeout</code> inside the IBC hook for the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback before the packet commitment is deleted. On chains where ibc-hooks wraps ICS-20, this vulnerability may allow for the logic of the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback of the transfer application to be recursively executed, leading to a condition that may present the opportunity for the loss of funds from the escrow account or unexpected minting of tokens.</p>
<h1 id="affected-configurations">Affected Configurations</h1>
<p>Chains which satisfy all of the following requirements are considered to be impacted by this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain is IBC-enabled and uses a vulnerable version of ibc-go</li>
<li>Chain is CosmWasm-enabled and allows code uploads for wasm contracts by anyone, or by authorized parties (to a lesser extent)</li>
<li>Chain utilizes the ibc-hooks middleware and wraps ICS-20 transfer application</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="next-steps-for-impacted-chain-builders-and-maintainers">Next Steps for Impacted Chain Builders and Maintainers</h1>
<p>It is advised to immediately upgrade to the latest patch fix version of ibc-go for your chain. If you have already applied a soft-patch through private coordination, we recommend additionally updating to the latest ibc-go version via normal software upgrade governance.</p>
<p>If you have not upgraded your chain yet, and you desire to mitigate exposure to this vulnerability in the meantime, it is advisable to limit code uploading for contracts to trusted parties on your chain.</p>
<p><strong>If your chain only allows permissioned, access-controlled contract uploads, it is still strongly recommended to update to the latest patched ibc-go version for your chain per your normal software upgrade process.</strong></p>
<h1 id="preparing-for-future-coordination">Preparing for future coordination</h1>
<p>If your chain would like to be included in future coordination efforts, please ensure your chain has a prominently displayed or otherwise easily available up-to-date email address for technical security contact available. A security.md file in the root of your projectsâ€™ code repository should contain this information. Additionally, please test this security contact with an unaffiliated email to ensure it works as expected and can receive emails from outside of your domain.</p>
<p>To ensure that your chain is included in future impact assessments, please keep your chain information up to date in the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry">Cosmos Chain Registry</a> with code location, network name, and public RPC and API endpoints in the details.</p>
<p>We recommend that all chains configure and practice the use of the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/circuit">Circuit Breaker module</a> in the Cosmos SDK, as future vulnerability notifications may require the use of this mechanism as a mitigation against exploitation.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Due to the critical nature of this issue, both the ibc-go team and Amulet independently performed impact assessments for the ecosystem, which informed a risk-driven private patching effort that preceded this public release. This private patching effort significantly reduced the exposure of the ecosystem to this vulnerability. We appreciate the diligence and professionalism of all chains and validators involved with this effort â€“ your ability to move quickly while maintaining confidentiality was instrumental in protecting the wider Interchain Ecosystem. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name</strong>: ASA-2024-007: Potential Reentrancy using Timeout Callbacks in ibc-hooks
<strong>Component</strong>: ibc-go
<strong>Criticality</strong>: Critical (<a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1</a>: I:Critical; L:AlmostCertain)
<strong>Affected versions</strong>: &lt; v4.6.0, &lt; v5.4.0, &lt; v6.3.0, &lt; v7.4.0, &lt; v8.2.0
<strong>Affected users</strong>: Chain Builders + Maintainers</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Through the deployment and subsequent use of a malicious CosmWasm contract via IBC interactions, an attacker could potentially execute the same <code>MsgTimeout</code> inside the IBC hook for the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback before the packet commitment is deleted. On chains where ibc-hooks wraps ICS-20, this vulnerability may allow for the logic of the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback of the transfer application to be recursively executed, leading to a condition that may present the opportunity for the loss of funds from the escrow account or unexpected minting of tokens.</p>
<h1 id="affected-configurations">Affected Configurations</h1>
<p>Chains which satisfy all of the following requirements are considered to be impacted by this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain is IBC-enabled and uses a vulnerable version of ibc-go</li>
<li>Chain is CosmWasm-enabled and allows code uploads for wasm contracts by anyone, or by authorized parties (to a lesser extent)</li>
<li>Chain utilizes the ibc-hooks middleware and wraps ICS-20 transfer application</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="next-steps-for-impacted-chain-builders-and-maintainers">Next Steps for Impacted Chain Builders and Maintainers</h1>
<p>It is advised to immediately upgrade to the latest patch fix version of ibc-go for your chain. If you have already applied a soft-patch through private coordination, we recommend additionally updating to the latest ibc-go version via normal software upgrade governance.</p>
<p>If you have not upgraded your chain yet, and you desire to mitigate exposure to this vulnerability in the meantime, it is advisable to limit code uploading for contracts to trusted parties on your chain.</p>
<p><strong>If your chain only allows permissioned, access-controlled contract uploads, it is still strongly recommended to update to the latest patched ibc-go version for your chain per your normal software upgrade process.</strong></p>
<h1 id="preparing-for-future-coordination">Preparing for future coordination</h1>
<p>If your chain would like to be included in future coordination efforts, please ensure your chain has a prominently displayed or otherwise easily available up-to-date email address for technical security contact available. A security.md file in the root of your projectsâ€™ code repository should contain this information. Additionally, please test this security contact with an unaffiliated email to ensure it works as expected and can receive emails from outside of your domain.</p>
<p>To ensure that your chain is included in future impact assessments, please keep your chain information up to date in the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry">Cosmos Chain Registry</a> with code location, network name, and public RPC and API endpoints in the details.</p>
<p>We recommend that all chains configure and practice the use of the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/circuit">Circuit Breaker module</a> in the Cosmos SDK, as future vulnerability notifications may require the use of this mechanism as a mitigation against exploitation.</p>

<p>This issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 3/26/24 by Maxwell Dulin (Strikeout) at <a href="https://www.asymmetric.re/">Asymmetric Research</a>. If you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see <a href="https://hackerone.com/cosmos">https://hackerone.com/cosmos</a>.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Due to the critical nature of this issue, both the ibc-go team and Amulet independently performed impact assessments for the ecosystem, which informed a risk-driven private patching effort that preceded this public release. This private patching effort significantly reduced the exposure of the ecosystem to this vulnerability. We appreciate the diligence and professionalism of all chains and validators involved with this effort â€“ your ability to move quickly while maintaining confidentiality was instrumental in protecting the wider Interchain Ecosystem. </p>
<p>If you ever have questions about security coordination efforts, public or private, please reach out to our official communication channel at <a href="mailto:security@interchain.io">security@interchain.io</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name</strong>: ASA-2024-007: Potential Reentrancy using Timeout Callbacks in ibc-hooks
<strong>Component</strong>: ibc-go
<strong>Criticality</strong>: Critical (<a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1</a>: I:Critical; L:AlmostCertain)
<strong>Affected versions</strong>: &lt; v4.6.0, &lt; v5.4.0, &lt; v6.3.0, &lt; v7.4.0, &lt; v8.2.0
<strong>Affected users</strong>: Chain Builders + Maintainers</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Through the deployment and subsequent use of a malicious CosmWasm contract via IBC interactions, an attacker could potentially execute the same <code>MsgTimeout</code> inside the IBC hook for the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback before the packet commitment is deleted. On chains where ibc-hooks wraps ICS-20, this vulnerability may allow for the logic of the <code>OnTimeout</code> callback of the transfer application to be recursively executed, leading to a condition that may present the opportunity for the loss of funds from the escrow account or unexpected minting of tokens.</p>
<h1 id="affected-configurations">Affected Configurations</h1>
<p>Chains which satisfy all of the following requirements are considered to be impacted by this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain is IBC-enabled and uses a vulnerable version of ibc-go</li>
<li>Chain is CosmWasm-enabled and allows code uploads for wasm contracts by anyone, or by authorized parties (to a lesser extent)</li>
<li>Chain utilizes the ibc-hooks middleware and wraps ICS-20 transfer application</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="next-steps-for-impacted-chain-builders-and-maintainers">Next Steps for Impacted Chain Builders and Maintainers</h1>
<p>It is advised to immediately upgrade to the latest patch fix version of ibc-go for your chain. If you have already applied a soft-patch through private coordination, we recommend additionally updating to the latest ibc-go version via normal software upgrade governance.</p>
<p>If you have not upgraded your chain yet, and you desire to mitigate exposure to this vulnerability in the meantime, it is advisable to limit code uploading for contracts to trusted parties on your chain.</p>
<p><strong>If your chain only allows permissioned, access-controlled contract uploads, it is still strongly recommended to update to the latest patched ibc-go version for your chain per your normal software upgrade process.</strong></p>
<h1 id="preparing-for-future-coordination">Preparing for future coordination</h1>
<p>If your chain would like to be included in future coordination efforts, please ensure your chain has a prominently displayed or otherwise easily available up-to-date email address for technical security contact available. A security.md file in the root of your projectsâ€™ code repository should contain this information. Additionally, please test this security contact with an unaffiliated email to ensure it works as expected and can receive emails from outside of your domain.</p>
<p>To ensure that your chain is included in future impact assessments, please keep your chain information up to date in the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry">Cosmos Chain Registry</a> with code location, network name, and public RPC and API endpoints in the details.</p>
<p>We recommend that all chains configure and practice the use of the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/circuit">Circuit Breaker module</a> in the Cosmos SDK, as future vulnerability notifications may require the use of this mechanism as a mitigation against exploitation.</p>
<h1 id="recognition">Recognition</h1>
<p>This issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 3/26/24 by Maxwell Dulin (Strikeout) at <a href="https://www.asymmetric.re/">Asymmetric Research</a>. If you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see <a href="https://hackerone.com/cosmos">https://hackerone.com/cosmos</a>.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Due to the critical nature of this issue, both the ibc-go team and Amulet independently performed impact assessments for the ecosystem, which informed a risk-driven private patching effort that preceded this public release. This private patching effort significantly reduced the exposure of the ecosystem to this vulnerability. We appreciate the diligence and professionalism of all chains and validators involved with this effort â€“ your ability to move quickly while maintaining confidentiality was instrumental in protecting the wider Interchain Ecosystem. </p>
<p>If you ever have questions about security coordination efforts, public or private, please reach out to our official communication channel at <a href="mailto:security@interchain.io">security@interchain.io</a>.</p>
