        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>SAML Service Providers using this library for SAML authentication support are likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library enables attackers to craft a <code>deflate</code>-compressed request which will consume significantly more memory during processing than the size of the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3>
<p>The maximum compression ratio achievable with <code>deflate</code> is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process it <em>may</em> be possible to help Go's garbage collector "keep up".</p>
<p>Implementors are encouraged not to rely on this.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This issue is addressed in v0.9.0</p>

The misconfiguration was due to the way that <code>cloudflared</code> reads its configuration file. One of the locations that <code>cloudflared</code> reads from (C:\etc) is not a secure by default directory due to the fact that Windows does not enforce access controls on this directory without further controls applied. A malformed config.yaml file can be written by any user. Upon reading this config, <code>cloudflared</code> would output an error message to a log file defined in the malformed config. The user-controlled log file location could be set to a specific location that Windows will execute when any user logs in.</p>

<p>There are no protocols known at this time that can be attacked due to this.</p>
<p>From the fix commit notes:</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete
addition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the
correct value if the two inputs are equal.</p>
<p>This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops
because as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is
lower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.</p>
<p>As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing
the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption
that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.</p>

<p>On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin "Text".</p>
<p>The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to  React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. later, an another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on "Markdown" or "HTML" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.   </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin "Text".</p>
<p>The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to  React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. later, an another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on "Markdown" or "HTML" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.   </p>

<p>teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. teler-waf prior to version v0.2.0 is vulnerable to a bypass attack when a specific case-sensitive hex entities payload with special characters such as CR/LF and horizontal tab is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The golang AWS S3 Crypto SDK was impacted by an issue that can result in loss of confidentiality. An attacker with read access to an encrypted S3 bucket was able to recover the plaintext without accessing the encryption key.</p>
<h3 id="riskseverity">Risk/Severity</h3>
<p>The vulnerability poses insider risks/privilege escalation risks, circumventing KMS controls for stored data.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The issue has been fully mitigated by AWS as of Aug. 5th by disallowing the header in question.</p>
<p>The S3 crypto library tries to store an unencrypted hash of the plaintext alongside the ciphertext as a metadata field. This hash can be used to brute force the plaintext in an offline attack, if the hash is readable to the attacker. In order to be impacted by this issue, the attacker has to be able to guess the plaintext as a whole. The attack is theoretically valid if the plaintext entropy is below the key size, i.e. if it is easier to brute force the plaintext instead of the key itself, but practically feasible only for short plaintexts or plaintexts otherwise accessible to the attacker in order to create a rainbow table.</p>
<p>The issue has been fixed server-side by AWS as of Aug 5th, by blocking the related metadata field. No S3 objects are affected anymore.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3>
<p>The header in question is no longer served by AWS, making this attack fully mitigated as of Aug. 5th.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc">Proof of concept</a> is available in a separate github repository, this particular issue can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/blob/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc/exploit/hash_exploit.go">here</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-golang">func HashExploit(bucket string, key string, input *OfflineAttackInput) (string, error) {
    _, header, err := input.S3Mock.GetObjectDirect(bucket, key)
    length, err := strconv.Atoi(header.Get("X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Length"))
    plaintextMd5 := header.Get("X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Md5")
    blocks := length / 16
    possiblePlaintextNum := 1
    segNum := len(input.PossiblePlaintextSegments)
    for i := 0; i &lt; blocks; i++ {
        possiblePlaintextNum *= segNum
    }
    for i := 0; i &lt; possiblePlaintextNum; i++ {
        w := i
        guess := ""
        for j := 0; j &lt; blocks; j++ {
            guess += input.PossiblePlaintextSegments[w%segNum]
            w /= segNum
        }
        guessMd5 := md5.Sum([]byte(guess))
        if plaintextMd5 == base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(guessMd5[:]) {
            return guess, nil
        }
    }
    return "", fmt.Errorf("No plaintext found!")
}
</code></pre>
<p>The PoC will only work on old versions of the library, as the hash has been removed from being calculated as well.</p>
