        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Minder REST ingester is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via an attacker-controlled REST endpoint that can crash the Minder server.</p>
<p>The REST ingester allows users to interact with REST endpoints to fetch data for rule evaluation. When fetching data with the REST ingester, Minder sends a request to an endpoint and will use the data from the body of the response as the data to evaluate against a certain rule. Minder sends the request on these lines:
<a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L131-L139">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L131-L139</a></p>
<p>â€¦ and parses the response body on these lines:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L147-L150">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L147-L150</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L196-L220">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L196-L220</a></p>
<p>Minder creates the URL of the endpoint via templating on these lines:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L121-L123">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L121-L123</a></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, at this stage in rule evaluation, users fully control the raw template and the params passed to the template via the RuleType type:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/pkg/api/protobuf/go/minder/v1/minder.pb.go#L6151-L6173">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/pkg/api/protobuf/go/minder/v1/minder.pb.go#L6151-L6173</a></p>
<p>I have not seen anything that enforces users to only send requests to GitHub REST endpoints. If there is such a constraint, it limits the ease with which this vulnerability can be exploited, but it is still possible. If there is not such a constraint, it is easy to exploit this vuln.</p>
<p>When Minder parses the response from a remote endpoint, it reads the response entirely into memory on these lines:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L207">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L207</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L213">https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/engine/ingester/rest/rest.go#L213</a></p>
<p>If the response is sufficiently large, it can drain memory on the machine and crash the Minder server.</p>
<p>The attacker can control the remote REST endpoints that Minder sends requests to, and they can configure the remote REST endpoints to return responses with large bodies.  They would then instruct Minder to send a request to their configured endpoint that would return the large response which would crash the Minder server.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A git authentication issue allows a local userâ€™s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than <code>github.com</code>.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own <code>git</code> package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. Thereâ€™s a central function <code>GetGitAuth</code>:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6/pkg/git/git.go#L22">https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6/pkg/git/git.go#L22</a></p>
<p>This looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the <code>github.com/go-git/go-git/v5</code> library.</p>
<p>Most callers (direct or indirect) of <code>GetGitAuth</code> use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com.</p>
<h4 id="issue-1">Issue 1</h4>
<p>One of these callers processed git URLs from Melange package configurations, cloning the packageâ€™s upstream repository in order to determine which project dependencies have been upgraded since the prior update.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go#L49">https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go#L49</a></p>
<p>This issue affects the command <code>wolfictl check update</code>, and the set of remote git hosts is a function of the Melange package configuration files residing in the local directory specified in the command.</p>
<h4 id="issue-2">Issue 2</h4>
<p>Another caller processes a git URL received as a command line argument and clones the repository to look for new available versions of the given project.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7/pkg/update/update.go#L143">https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7/pkg/update/update.go#L143</a></p>
<p>This issue affects the command <code>wolfictl update</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>This behavior has existed in one form or another since <a href="https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0">https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0</a> - committed January 25, 2023.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<pre><code class="language-shell">GITHUB_TOKEN=test wolfictl update http://git.example.com/
</code></pre>
<p>Examining traffic sent to the remote server will show that the HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header contains <code>test</code> in base64 encoded format.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This impacts anyone who ran the <code>wolfictl check update</code> commands with a Melange configuration that included a <code>git-checkout</code> directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. </p>
<p>This also impacts anyone who ran <code>wolfictl update &lt;url&gt;</code> with a remote URL outside of github.com. </p>
<p>Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable set to a valid GitHub token.</p>

<p>Since #4787 the log output is printed on the INFO level, while previously it was logged on DEBUG. This means if the <code>go build</code> output is non-empty, goreleaser leaks the environment.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a Go project with dependencies, do not pull them yet (or run goreleaser later in a container, or delete <code>$GOPATH/pkg</code>).</li>

<li>Make sure to not have <code>go mod tidy</code> in a before hook</li>
<li>Run <code>goreleaser release --clean</code></li>
<li>Go prints lots of <code>go: downloading ...</code> lines, which triggers the "if output not empty, log it" line, which includes the environment.</li>

<p>When source-controller is configured to use an <a href="https://v2-2.docs.fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/#azure-blob-sas-token-example">Azure SAS token</a> when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing, organizing and sharing application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder.&nbsp;The routine <code>untarFile</code> attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking <code>subdir/parent</code> to <code>..</code> (allowed, because <code>subdir/..</code> falls within the archive root) and then linking <code>subdir/parent/escapes</code> to <code>..</code> results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarballâ€™s parent directory, contrary to the routineâ€™s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.</p>

<p>The way the proxy protocol listener is implemented in sshpiper can allow an attacker to forge their connecting address.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/commit/2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430">This commit</a> added the proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>You can use a configuration like this in HAProxy:</p>
<pre><code>listen w-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:27654
    tcp-request connection set-src ipv4(1.1.1.1)
    server app1 ssh-piper-hostname:22 send-proxy
</code></pre>
<p>When connecting through HAProxy, sshpiper will log connections as originating from <code>1.1.1.1</code>.  The proxy protocol data is designed to survive multiple load balancers or proxies and pass through to sshpiper at the end, so it should only be enabled trusted environments. This should be behind a configuration option or startup flag to prevent abuse when public connections can be made to sshpiper.</p>
<p>This is also backed up by <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">the specification for proxy protocol</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The receiver MUST be configured to only receive the protocol described in this
specification and MUST not try to guess whether the protocol header is present
or not. This means that the protocol explicitly prevents port sharing between
public and private access. Otherwise it would open a major security breach by
allowing untrusted parties to spoof their connection addresses. The receiver
SHOULD ensure proper access filtering so that only trusted proxies are allowed
to use this protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.</p>

This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure's Grafana as a service offering.</p>
<h2 id="privilege-escalation-cve-2022-36062">Privilege escalation (CVE-2022-36062)</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>On August 29 we have received a bug report for Grafana role-based access control (RBAC) and confirmed a vulnerability in the Grafana. This vulnerability impacts folders/dashboards with Admin only permissions and where RBAC was ever enabled at least once.</p>
<p>When RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations which translate legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards which only had Admin role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers can view the folder/dashboard which they should not have access to.</p>
<p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).</p>
<h3 id="impacted-versions">Impacted versions</h3>
<p>All Grafana installations where the <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/">RBAC</a> was at least enabled once and there are folders/dashboards with only Admin grant.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>To fully address CVE-2022-36062 please upgrade your Grafana instances. They are only required if you have ever enabled RBAC and have dashboards/folders where Admin is the only permission..</p>
<p>If you canâ€™t upgrade, as a workaround when impacted folder/dashboard is known, the additional permissions can be removed manually.</p>
<p>Appropriate patches have been applied to <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud">Grafana Cloud</a>.</p>

<h2 id="privilege-escalation-cve-2022-36062">Privilege escalation (CVE-2022-36062)</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>On August 29 we have received a bug report for Grafana role-based access control (RBAC) and confirmed a vulnerability in the Grafana. This vulnerability impacts folders/dashboards with Admin only permissions and where RBAC was ever enabled at least once.</p>
<p>When RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations which translate legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards which only had Admin role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers can view the folder/dashboard which they should not have access to.</p>
<p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).</p>
<h3 id="impacted-versions">Impacted versions</h3>
<p>All Grafana installations where the <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/">RBAC</a> was at least enabled once and there are folders/dashboards with only Admin grant.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>To fully address CVE-2022-36062 please upgrade your Grafana instances. They are only required if you have ever enabled RBAC and have dashboards/folders where Admin is the only permission..</p>
<p>If you canâ€™t upgrade, as a workaround when impacted folder/dashboard is known, the additional permissions can be removed manually.</p>
<p>Appropriate patches have been applied to <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud">Grafana Cloud</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improper-authentication---cve-2022-39229">Improper authentication - CVE-2022-39229</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>On September 7 as a result of an internal security audit we have discovered a security vulnerability in Grafana basic authentication, related to the usage of username and email address. </p>
<p>In Grafana, a userâ€™s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. </p>
<p>In addition, a user can have an email address as a username and Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email address. This creates an unusual behavior, where <em>user_1</em> can register with one email address and <em>user_2</em> can register their username as _user_1_â€™s email address. As a result, <em>user_1</em> would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since <em>user_1</em> password wonâ€™t match with <em>users_2</em> email address.</p>
<p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).</p>
<h3 id="impacted-versions">Impacted versions</h3>
<p>All installations for Grafana versions &lt;=9.x, &lt;=8.x</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>To fully address CVE-2022-39229 please upgrade your Grafana instances. 
Appropriate patches have been applied to <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud">Grafana Cloud</a>.</p>
