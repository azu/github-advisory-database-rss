        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>SAML Service Providers using this library for SAML authentication support are likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library enables attackers to craft a <code>deflate</code>-compressed request which will consume significantly more memory during processing than the size of the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3>
<p>The maximum compression ratio achievable with <code>deflate</code> is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process it <em>may</em> be possible to help Go's garbage collector "keep up".</p>
<p>Implementors are encouraged not to rely on this.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This issue is addressed in v0.9.0</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with the 7.0 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the trace view visualization. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of a span's attributes/resources were not properly sanitized and this will be rendered when the span's attributes/resources are expanded. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value of a trace view visualization to contain JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.</p>

The misconfiguration was due to the way that <code>cloudflared</code> reads its configuration file. One of the locations that <code>cloudflared</code> reads from (C:\etc) is not a secure by default directory due to the fact that Windows does not enforce access controls on this directory without further controls applied. A malformed config.yaml file can be written by any user. Upon reading this config, <code>cloudflared</code> would output an error message to a log file defined in the malformed config. The user-controlled log file location could be set to a specific location that Windows will execute when any user logs in.</p>

<p>There are no protocols known at this time that can be attacked due to this.</p>
<p>From the fix commit notes:</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete
addition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the
correct value if the two inputs are equal.</p>
<p>This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops
because as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is
lower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.</p>
<p>As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing
the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption
that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.</p>
