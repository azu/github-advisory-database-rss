        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows command injection via path traversal, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the "Docker" strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the <code>spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir</code> attribute of the <code>BuildConfig</code> definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.</p>

        <updated>2024-09-16T16:13:43.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name</strong>: ASA-2024-009: State syncing validator from malicious node may lead to a chain split
<strong>Component</strong>: CometBFT
<strong>Criticality</strong>: Medium (<a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>: I:Moderate; L: Possible)
<strong>Affected versions</strong>: &gt;= 0.34.0, &lt;= 0.34.33, &gt;=0.37.0, &lt;= 0.37.10, &gt;= 0.38.0, &lt;= 0.38.11</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The state sync protocol retrieves a snapshot of the application and installs it in a fresh node. In order for this node to be ready to run consensus and block sync from the installed snapshot height, we also need to install a valid <code>State</code> in the node, which is the starting state from which it is able to validate new blocks and append them to the blockchain.</p>
<p>The <code>State</code> object used by state sync is computed using the light client protocol, which retrieves information about committed blocks from at least two RPC endpoints. The light client protocol performs several state validations and, in particular, compares the state provided by different RPC endpoints, looking for inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The <code>State</code> object contains, among other fields, a <code>Validators</code> field which stores the current validator set. A validator set is a list of validator addresses, public keys and associated voting powers, one per validator. It also stores, for historical reasons, the state of the proposer selection algorithm, in the form of the <code>ProposerPriority</code> field associated with each <code>Validator</code>.</p>
<p>While the light client is able to validate the <code>ValidatorSet</code> retrieved from RPC endpoints, this validation does not include the <code>ProposerPriority</code> field associated with each <code>Validator</code>. As a result, when state sync adopts RPC endpoints that, for unknown reasons, provide an invalid state of the proposer selection algorithm, the node will not be able to properly run the consensus protocol, as their local view of which validator is the proposer of a given round and height will disagree with the views of the correct validators. If an increasing number of validators state sync using RPC endpoints with invalid states, the network eventually halts.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Release versions 0.34.34, 0.37.11, and 0.38.12 include a patch to address this issue.</p>
<p>In the patched versions, the light client protocol compares the <code>ProposerPriority</code> fields of the <code>ValidatorSet</code> instances retrieved from the RPC endpoints configured for state sync. If they differ, the computed <code>State</code> object is considered invalid and state sync will fail with an error.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The issue is observed when validators run state sync using RPC nodes that are malicious or report invalid states for the proposer selection algorithm.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that non-malicious nodes running upstream software should never report an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm. This situation may result from the adoption of nodes with customized code or which had their state, stored in local databases, manually updated.</p>
<p>When the network public's RPC endpoints have an invalid state for the proposer election algorithm, there, new validators should refrain from using state sync for bootstrapping or be sure that they configure for state sync RPC endpoints with a valid state of the proposer election algorithm.</p>
<p>A validator with an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm will reject most of the proposed blocks and will have the network rejecting blocks it has proposed.  It is also possible to manually compare the state of the proposer election algorithm of nodes by comparing the outputs of the <code>/validators?height=_</code>  RPC endpoints. The outputs must fully match, including the ProposerPriority field associated with each validator. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name</strong>: ASA-2024-009: State syncing validator from malicious node may lead to a chain split
<strong>Component</strong>: CometBFT
<strong>Criticality</strong>: Medium (<a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>: I:Moderate; L: Possible)
<strong>Affected versions</strong>: &gt;= 0.34.0, &lt;= 0.34.33, &gt;=0.37.0, &lt;= 0.37.10, &gt;= 0.38.0, &lt;= 0.38.11</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The state sync protocol retrieves a snapshot of the application and installs it in a fresh node. In order for this node to be ready to run consensus and block sync from the installed snapshot height, we also need to install a valid <code>State</code> in the node, which is the starting state from which it is able to validate new blocks and append them to the blockchain.</p>
<p>The <code>State</code> object used by state sync is computed using the light client protocol, which retrieves information about committed blocks from at least two RPC endpoints. The light client protocol performs several state validations and, in particular, compares the state provided by different RPC endpoints, looking for inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The <code>State</code> object contains, among other fields, a <code>Validators</code> field which stores the current validator set. A validator set is a list of validator addresses, public keys and associated voting powers, one per validator. It also stores, for historical reasons, the state of the proposer selection algorithm, in the form of the <code>ProposerPriority</code> field associated with each <code>Validator</code>.</p>
<p>While the light client is able to validate the <code>ValidatorSet</code> retrieved from RPC endpoints, this validation does not include the <code>ProposerPriority</code> field associated with each <code>Validator</code>. As a result, when state sync adopts RPC endpoints that, for unknown reasons, provide an invalid state of the proposer selection algorithm, the node will not be able to properly run the consensus protocol, as their local view of which validator is the proposer of a given round and height will disagree with the views of the correct validators. If an increasing number of validators state sync using RPC endpoints with invalid states, the network eventually halts.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Release versions 0.34.34, 0.37.11, and 0.38.12 include a patch to address this issue.</p>
<p>In the patched versions, the light client protocol compares the <code>ProposerPriority</code> fields of the <code>ValidatorSet</code> instances retrieved from the RPC endpoints configured for state sync. If they differ, the computed <code>State</code> object is considered invalid and state sync will fail with an error.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The issue is observed when validators run state sync using RPC nodes that are malicious or report invalid states for the proposer selection algorithm.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that non-malicious nodes running upstream software should never report an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm. This situation may result from the adoption of nodes with customized code or which had their state, stored in local databases, manually updated.</p>
<p>When the network public's RPC endpoints have an invalid state for the proposer election algorithm, there, new validators should refrain from using state sync for bootstrapping or be sure that they configure for state sync RPC endpoints with a valid state of the proposer election algorithm.</p>
<p>A validator with an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm will reject most of the proposed blocks and will have the network rejecting blocks it has proposed.  It is also possible to manually compare the state of the proposer election algorithm of nodes by comparing the outputs of the <code>/validators?height=_</code>  RPC endpoints. The outputs must fully match, including the ProposerPriority field associated with each validator. </p>

        <updated>2024-09-16T16:07:15.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This report concerns the Groth16 prover when used with commitments (as in <code>frontend.Committer</code>). To simplify exposition of the issue, I will focus on the case of a single commitment, to only private witnesses. But the issue should be present whenever commitments are used that include private witnesses.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The commitment to private witnesses <code>w_i</code> is computed as</p>
<pre><code>c = sum_i w_i * b_i
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>b_i</code> would be <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys[0].Basis[i]</code> in the code.</p>
<p>While this is a binding commitment, it is not hiding. In practice, an adversary will know the points <code>b_i</code>, as they are part of the proving key, and can verify correctness of a guess for the values of <code>w_i</code> by computing <code>c'</code> as the right hand side of the above formula, and checking whether <code>c'</code> is equal to <code>c</code>. I attach a proof of concept that demonstrates this.</p>
<p>This breaks the perfect zero-knowledge property of Groth16, so the Groth16 scheme using commitments to private witnesses as implemented by gnark fails to be a zk-SNARK.</p>
<p>The code indicates that the extension to Groth16 given by the commitments follows the paper "Recursion over Public-Coin Interactive Proof Systems; Faster Hash Verification" by Alexandre Belling, Azam Soleimanian, and Olivier Begassat. In that paper, it seems that commitments are applied to what were originally public inputs, which are moved to private witnesses for efficiency reasons. In any case, that paper does not discuss any hiding/privacy/zero-knowledge properties of their protocols.</p>
<p>So for the use-cases envisioned by that paper, having the commitment not be hiding and losing zero-knowledge of Groth16 might be adequate. However, the documentation by gnark does not make clear that committing to private witnesses loses the zero-knowledge property. The documentation for <code>frontend.Committer</code> does not mention this, and the following snippet from <code>std/multicommit/doc_test.go</code>, where private witness variables are named <code>Secrets</code> and are committed, seems to actively suggest that committed witnesses are still private.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// MultipleCommitmentCircuit is an example circuit showing usage of multiple
// independent commitments in-circuit.
type MultipleCommitmentsCircuit struct {
    Secrets [4]frontend.Variable
}

func (c *MultipleCommitmentsCircuit) Define(api frontend.API) error {
    // first callback receives first unique commitment derived from the root commitment
    multicommit.WithCommitment(api, func(api frontend.API, commitment frontend.Variable) error {
        // compute (X-s[0]) * (X-s[1]) for a random X
        res := api.Mul(api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[0]), api.Sub(commitment, c.Secrets[1]))
        api.AssertIsDifferent(res, 0)
        return nil
    }, c.Secrets[:2]...)
   // ...
</code></pre>
<p>Thus it seems to me that the intention likely was (and users will be expecting) that gnark's implementation of Groth16 with these commitments should still have zero-knowledge and that the commitments should be hiding.</p>
<p>The way to fix this is likely to adjust the commitment to be hiding the way that is done in the LegoSNARK paper (<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>). To expand:</p>
<p>First, let me fix some notation.</p>
<p>Currently, the verifying key has two points on G2 used for checking the proof of knowledge for the commitment: <code>g</code> and <code>g'=-1/σ * g</code> (in the code: <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.G</code> and <code>VerifyingKey.CommitmentKey.GRootSigmaNeg</code>).
The commitment itself is then <code>c = sum_i w_i * b_i</code>, where <code>b_i</code> are on G1, and the proof of knowledge associated to <code>c</code> is calculated as <code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i</code>, where <code>b'_i = σ*b_i</code> (in the code <code>b_i</code> and <code>b'_i</code> are <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.Basis[0][i]</code> and <code>ProvingKey.CommitmentKeys.BasisExpSigma[0][i]</code>). The proof of knowledge is then verified by checking <code>e(c, g) + e(pok, g') = 0</code> (I am using additive notation throughout here).</p>
<p>The Groth16 proof is verified by checking</p>
<pre><code>e(Krs, -[δ]₂) + e(c, -[γ]₂) + e(term involving public inputs, -[γ]₂) + other terms = 0
</code></pre>
<p>The construction ccGro16 from the LegoSNARK paper (page 73 in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142.pdf</a>) is a similar construction. They do not have a proof of knowledge accompanying the commitment because they are considering the case where there are no public inputs. However, they claim that their scheme is zero-knowledge, and the crucial difference for this is that their commitment has an extra blinding term as is usual for Pedersen commitments. Concretely, it is of the form:</p>
<pre><code>c_new = sum_i w_i * b_i + v*[η/γ]₁
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[η/γ]₁</code> is a new element of G1 that is part of the proving key, with <code>η</code> a new toxic waste field element. The value of <code>v</code> is randomly chosen by the prover.</p>
<p>When adding this additional term to <code>c</code>, then to make the proof verification still succeeds, the proof point <code>Krs</code> is changed accordingly:</p>
<pre><code>Krs_new = Krs_old -  v*[η/δ]₁
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[η/δ]₁</code> is another new element of G1 that is part of the proving key. As <code>e([η/γ]₁, -[γ]₂) = e([η/δ]₁, -[δ]₂)</code>, the contributions from the new terms cancel each other in the proof verification pairing check.</p>
<p>This modification should ensure that the commitment is hiding.</p>
<p>The proof of knowledge would also need to be adapted accordingly, with</p>
<pre><code>pok = sum_i w_i * b'_i + v*[σ*η/γ]₁
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[σ*η/γ]₁</code> is another point of G1 to add to the proving key.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably, PLONK proofs are not affected.</p>
<p>The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small, then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed, then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices.</p>
<p>It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in <a href="https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245">https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1245</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in the Rancher UI. 
Cross-Site scripting allows a malicious user to inject code that is executed within another user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate web content, or perform other malicious activities on behalf of the victims. This could result in a user with write access to the affected areas being able to act on behalf of an administrator, once an administrator opens the affected web page.</p>
<p>The affected areas include the Projects/Namespaces and Auth Provider sections. The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write access to those features in order to exploit the vulnerabilities. Some of the permissions (roles) required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Owner.</li>
<li>Restricted Admin.</li>
<li>Configure Authentication.</li>
<li>Administrator.</li>
<li>Custom RBAC Role that provides write access on Projects or External Authentication Providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For users that suspect this vulnerability may have targeted their Rancher instance, we recommend rotating all API Keys and Kubeconfig tokens.</p>
<p>It's also advised to review logs and possibly rotate credentials stored as secrets in Rancher and downstream cluster, if you believe that users' credentials to access Rancher and its clusters might have been compromised.</p>

<p>Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in the Rancher UI. 
Cross-Site scripting allows a malicious user to inject code that is executed within another user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate web content, or perform other malicious activities on behalf of the victims. This could result in a user with write access to the affected areas being able to act on behalf of an administrator, once an administrator opens the affected web page.</p>
<p>The affected areas include the Projects/Namespaces and Auth Provider sections. The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write access to those features in order to exploit the vulnerabilities. Some of the permissions (roles) required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Owner.</li>
<li>Restricted Admin.</li>
<li>Configure Authentication.</li>
<li>Administrator.</li>
<li>Custom RBAC Role that provides write access on Projects or External Authentication Providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For users that suspect this vulnerability may have targeted their Rancher instance, we recommend rotating all API Keys and Kubeconfig tokens.</p>
<p>It's also advised to review logs and possibly rotate credentials stored as secrets in Rancher and downstream cluster, if you believe that users' credentials to access Rancher and its clusters might have been compromised.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Patched versions include releases <code>2.6.13</code>, <code>2.7.4</code> and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.</p>
