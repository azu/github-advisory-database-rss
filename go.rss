<p><strong>Affected platforms:</strong> All
<strong>Patched Tailscale client versions:</strong> v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h3>
<p>All Tailscale clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?</h3>
<p>Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact">What is the impact?</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.</p>
<p>An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon <code>tailscaled</code>, which can then be used to remotely execute code.</p>
<p><strong>Affected platforms:</strong> Windows
<strong>Patched Tailscale client versions:</strong> v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h3>
<p>All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?</h3>
<p>If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact">What is the impact?</h3>
<p>An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.</p>
<p>Reviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The following Go SDK versions are not vulnerable</p>

<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>When initializing an immudb client object, a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID, client will still consider it to be the same server.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>In certain scenario a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value.</p>
<p>This vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-description">Detailed description</h3>
<p>immudb uses Merkle Tree enhanced with additional linear part to perform consistency proofs between two transactions. The linear part is built from the last leaf node of the Merkle Tree compensating for transactions that were not yet consumed by the Merkle Tree calculation.</p>
<p>The Merkle Tree part is then used to perform proofs for things that are in transaction range covered by the Merkle Tree where the linear part is used to check those that are not yet in the Merkle Tree.</p>
<p>When doing consistency checks between two immudb states, the linear proof part is not fully checked. In fact only the first (last Merkle Tree leaf) and the last (current DB state value) are checked against new Merkle Tree without ensuring that elements in the middle of that chain are correctly added as Merkle Tree leafs.</p>
<p>This lack of check means that the database can present different set of hashes on the linear proof part to what would later be used once those become part of the Merkle Tree. This property can be exploited by the database to expose two different transaction entries depending on the other transaction that the user requested consistency proof for.</p>
<p>In practice this could lead to a following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>a client requests a verified write operation</li>
<li>the server responds with a proof for the transaction</li>
<li>client stores the state value retrieved from the server and expects it to be a confirmation of that write and all the history of the database before that transaction</li>
<li>a series of validated read / write operations is performed by the client, each accompanied by a successfully validated consistency proof and update of the client state</li>
<li>the client requests verified get operation on the transaction it has written before (and that was verified with a proof from the server)</li>
<li>the server replies with a completely different transaction that can be properly validated according to the currently stored db state on the client side</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The following Go SDK versions is not vulnerable</p>

<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Invalid proofs can not be generated in a normal immudb server and will be detected by a genuine replica server.
To ensure that the server does not produce invalid proofs and to check that the history presented by the server
does not contain falsified transactions, one should run a genuine immudb replica server in a safe environment
and fully synchronize all databases with the primary.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>All lnd nodes before version <code>v0.15.4</code> are vulnerable to a block parsing bug that can cause a node to enter a degraded state once encountered. In this degraded state, nodes can continue to make payments and forward HTLCs, and close out channels. Opening channels is prohibited, and also on chain transaction events will be undetected. </p>
<p>This can cause loss of funds if a CSV expiry is researched during a breach attempt or a CLTV delta expires forgetting the funds in the HTLC. </p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>A patch is available starting with lnd <code>v0.15.4</code>. </p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Nodes can use the <code>lncli updatechanpolicy</code> RPC call to increase their CLTV value to a very high amount or increase their fee policies. This will prevent nodes from routing through your node, meaning that no pending HTLCs can be present. </p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25"/>
        <updated>2022-11-11T00:03:32.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Moby is the open source Linux container runtime and set of components used to build a variety of downstream container runtimes, including Docker CE, Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker EE), and Docker Desktop. Moby allows for building container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to as a "Dockerfile"), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which the Dockerfile instructions are executed.</p>
<p>Containers may be built using a variety of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.</p>
<p>Versions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.</p>
<p>This issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.</p>
<p>As this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Moby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of <code>git+&lt;protocol&gt;://...</code> URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.</p>
<p>Specifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>docker build</code> with the legacy builder (e.g. <code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT</code> unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.</li>
<li><code>docker build</code> with the BuildKit builder (e.g. <code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1</code>) of a Git URL context.</li>
<li><code>docker buildx build</code> with <code>BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1</code> of a Git URL context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Patches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.</p>
<p>Patches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose <strong>cannot</strong> fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as <code>git clone --recursive</code>, <code>git submodule update</code>, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>While this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution. Users should not build a repository/build context they do not trust, as containerization cannot protect against all possible attacks.</p>
<p>When building with BuildKit (e.g. <code>docker buildx build</code> or <code>docker build</code> with <code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1</code>), this issue cannot be exploited unless <code>--build-arg BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1</code> was also passed, as by default BuildKit will discard the <code>.git</code> directory of a Git URL context immediately after cloning and checking out the repository.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Some current default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container breakouts.</p>
<h4 id="default-privileged-images">Default Privileged Images</h4>
<p>Running Vela plugins as privileged Docker containers allows a malicious user to easily break out of the container and gain access to the worker host operating system. On a fresh install of Vela without any additional configuration, the <code>target/vela-docker</code> plugin will run as a privileged container, even if the Vela administrators did not intend to allow for any privileged plugins, and even if the <code>vela.yml</code> configuration file does not use the <code>privileged = True</code> flag.</p>
<p>Privileged containers permit trivial breakouts, which can pose significant risk to the environment in which Vela is running.</p>
<h4 id="default-allowed-repositories">Default Allowed Repositories</h4>
<p>On a fresh install of Vela, anyone with a GitHub account (or other enabled source control management solution) is allowed to enable a repository within Vela and run builds. This means that, if a Vela instance is accessible to the public, a third party could add their own malicious repos to the Vela instance and run arbitrary code.</p>
<p>An example of a publicly accessible Vela instance would be one not protected behind a VPN. Whether Vela is publicly accessible depends on how Vela is set up, NOT how it is connected to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="default-enabled-events-allows-pull-requests">Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests</h4>
<p>By default, Vela currently enables pull request events when a repository is Vela-enabled. Unless this default was changed when enabling each repository, anyone who can issue a pull request against a repository can trigger a Vela job.</p>
<p>This not only permits a third party to run arbitrary code in a Vela environment, but also poses an additional risk when secrets within Vela are configured to be available in pull requests, permitting anyone with access to create pull requests to access these secrets.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Upgrade to 0.16.0 or later. After upgrading, Vela administrators will need to explicitly change the default settings to configure Vela as desired.</p>
<p>Some of the fixes will interrupt existing workflows and will require Vela administrators to modify default settings (see release notes for more information). However, not applying the patch (or workarounds) will continue existing risk exposure.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<h4 id="default-privileged-images-1">Default Privileged Images</h4>
<p>Instead of upgrading, the Vela administrators can adjust the worker's <code>VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES</code> setting to be explicitly empty:</p>
<p><code>VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES=""</code></p>
<p>By assigning <code>VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES</code> to an empty value it disallows any images from running as privileged containers in Vela.</p>
<h4 id="default-allowed-repositories-1">Default Allowed Repositories</h4>
<p>Instead of upgrading, the Vela administrators can leverage the <code>VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST</code> setting on the server component to restrict access to a list of repositories that are allowed to be enabled.</p>
<p>By changing it from the default empty list (currently interpreted by Vela as "all repositories") to a list explicitly allowing specific repositories, Vela administrators can control what repositories are allowed to be enabled in Vela.</p>
<p>Vela's current default list of approved repositories that can be added to a Vela instance is an empty list. However this is currently interpreted as allowing all repositories.</p>
<p>In the updated version, a null value (the empty list) will be interpreted as permitting no repositories to be added to a Vela instance.</p>
<h4 id="default-enabled-events-allows-pull-requests-1">Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests</h4>
<p>Audit enabled repositories and disable <code>pull_requests</code> if they are not needed.</p>
<p>Instead of upgrading, the pull request trigger can be disabled on a per-repository basis.</p>
<p>Additional protection can be provided by preventing unauthorized users from submitting pull requests in GitHub (or other source control management solution).</p>
<h3 id="residual-risk">Residual Risk</h3>
<h4 id="default-privileged-images-2">Default Privileged Images</h4>
<p>After applying the update, any repos that Vela administrators manually define as "trusted repos" will be able to run the manually-specified images that are allowed to run as privileged. Those repos will continue to be vulnerable to breakout, but applying the update will help protect against the risk of trivial breakout arising from an image running as a privileged container.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to utilize plugins that do not require privileged capabilities.</p>
<p>For example, utilize <code>target/vela-kaniko</code> instead of <code>target/vela-docker</code> as the Kaniko plugin does not require privileged access.</p>
<h4 id="default-allowed-repositories-2">Default Allowed Repositories</h4>
<p>Applying this update (or workaround) will protect against the risk of Vela interpreting the default empty list of approved repositories as "all repositories" rather than "no repositories" (the current default).</p>
<h4 id="default-enabled-events-allows-pull-requests-2">Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests</h4>
<p>Since this change only impacts newly enabled repositories, the update will not address the risk to existing enabled repositories resulting from Vela enabling pull request events when a repository is Vela-enabled.</p>
<p>Additionally, this change only impacts defaults; users can still configure their repositories to allow pull requests as triggering events.</p>
<p>In order to monitor risk going forward, refer to the <code>Workaround</code> section with the heading <code>Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests</code>.</p>
