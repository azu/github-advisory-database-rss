        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rp4v-hhm6-rcv9</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rp4v-hhm6-rcv9"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A user authenticating to Kubernetes clusters via the Pinniped Supervisor could potentially use their access token to continue their session beyond what proper use of their refresh token might allow.</p>
<p>Access tokens issued by the Pinniped Supervisor have an intended expiration lifetime of approximately two minutes. The Pinniped CLI will automatically use the refresh token, which has a lifetime of approximately nine hours, to request a new access token after the access token's advertised expiration time elapses. Starting in Pinniped v0.13.0, the Supervisor performs checks during each refresh request against the configured external identity provider to determine if the user should be allowed to continue their session. Thus, the short lifetime of the access token is intended to force users to be subjected to those checks often. For example, if a user's account in the external identity provider became locked, the next refresh would fail, and the user should lose access to the Kubernetes clusters fairly quickly. As another example, if a user's group membership changed in the external identity provider, the new group memberships would be reflected in their sessions with Kubernetes clusters within a fairly short window of time.</p>
<p>Access tokens are cached in a local file by the Pinniped CLI (the kubectl plugin) and are sent back to the Supervisor (via HTTPS) to receive cluster-scoped credentials. Due to a bug in this token exchange, the expiration time of the submitted access token was not checked correctly, causing expired access tokens to continue to be accepted by this endpoint until the user's backend session data is deleted, approximately nine hours after their session started. This bug could allow a legitimate user to avoid the checks performed during refresh by maliciously skipping the refresh step.</p>
<p>Note that the Pinniped CLI performs the refresh operation often, so the refresh checks are still performed often under normal usage of the CLI, despite this bug.</p>
<p>Practical impact to versions before v0.13.0 is minimal, since those versions did not perform checks against the external identity provider during refreshes. In these versions, the user can perform refreshes to get a new access tokens without restriction for approximately nine hours, so the duration of their access is effectively unchanged by this bug.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The impacted token exchange feature was first introduced in v0.3.0. Versions v0.3.0 to v0.18.0 are effected by this bug.</p>
<p>This vulnerability was found by the maintainers of Pinniped and fixed immediately. The fix was introduced in release v0.19.0.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There are no known workarounds. Upgrading the Supervisor is recommended, especially for users of v0.13.0 or newer.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line. The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed into the target Kubernetes cluster instead.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input, which results in a path traversal that can be controlled by the attacker.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Users sharing the same shell between other applications and the Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability.</p>
<p>In some scenarios no errors may be presented, which may cause end users not to realise that something is amiss.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments, which can ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes. However, upgrading to the latest version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
<p>The Flux engineering team found and patched this vulnerability.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the <em>strvals</em> package that can cause an out of memory panic. Out of memory panics cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the <em>strvals</em> package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The <em>strvals</em> package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like <code>--set</code>, <code>--set-string</code>, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The <em>strvals</em> package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic.</p>
<p>Applications that use the <em>strvals</em> package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.</p>
<p>The Helm Client will panic with input to <code>--set</code>, <code>--set-string</code>, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. </p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the <em>strvals</em> functions.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>Smart contract applications that make use of the <code>selfdestruct</code> functionality and their end-users.</p>
<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<p>The vulnerability has been classified as <code>high</code> with a CVSS score of <code>8.2</code>. It has the potential to create a denial-of-service to all contracts that can invoke the <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/315/why-are-selfdestructs-used-in-contract-programming#347"><code>selfdestruct</code></a> function to destroy a smart contract. </p>
<h2 id="users-impacted">Users Impacted</h2>
<p>Due to the successfully coordinated security vulnerability disclosure, no smart contracts were impacted through the use of this vulnerability. Smart contract states and storage values are not affected by this vulnerability. User funds and balances are safe.</p>
<h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h2>
<p>In Ethermint running versions before <code>v0.17.2</code>, the contract <code>selfdestruct</code> invocation permanently removes the corresponding bytecode from the internal database storage. However, due to a bug in the <a href="https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/c9d42d667b753147977a725e98ed116c933c76cb/x/evm/keeper/statedb.go#L199-L203"><code>DeleteAccount</code></a> function, all contracts that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same <code>CodeHash</code>) will also stop working once one contract invokes <code>selfdestruct</code>, even though the other contracts did not invoke the <code>selfdestruct</code> OPCODE.</p>
<h3 id="additional-details">Additional Details</h3>
<p>The same contract bytecode can be deployed multiple times to create multiple contract instances. In the internal database, the bytecode is stored as a key-value entry <code>bytecode hash --&gt; bytecode</code> which is shared by those contracts. Unfortunately, when one of the contracts invokes <code>selfdestruct</code>, it will remove the corresponding <code>bytecode hash -&gt; bytecode</code> entry, and thus it disables all the contracts that share the same bytecode.</p>
<p>The attack scenario is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The malicious attacker identifies a vulnerable contract that can invoke <code>selfdestruct</code></li>
<li>The attacker deploys a copy of the contract with identical bytecode</li>
<li>Finally, the attacker triggers the <code>selfdestruct</code> operation on their redeployed contract, actively causing a DoS on the original and vulnerable contract. All transactions will fail until a workaround is used (see below).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="patches">Patches</h2>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been patched in Ethermint versions ≥<a href="https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.18.0">v0.18.0</a>. The patch has state machine-breaking changes for applications using Ethermint so a coordinated upgrade procedure is required.</p>
<h4 id="details">Details</h4>
<p>The patch removes the bytecode deletion logic, i.e. contract bytecodes are never deleted from the internal database after the patch.
At the moment, Ethermint does not track how many times each bytecode is used, and thus it cannot determine if it is safe to delete a particular bytecode on <code>selfdestruct</code> invocations. This behavior is the same with go-ethereum.</p>
<h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>
<p>If a contract is subject to DoS due to this issue, the user can redeploy the same contract, <em>i.e</em> with identical bytecode, so that the original contract's code is recovered.</p>
<p>The new contract deployment restores the <code>bytecode hash -&gt; bytecode</code> entry in the internal state.</p>
