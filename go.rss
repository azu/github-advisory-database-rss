        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mattermost does not strip <code>embeds</code> from <code>metadata</code> when broadcasting <code>posted</code> events.</p>
<p>This allows users to include arbitrary embeds in posts, which are then broadcasted via websockets. This can be exploited in many ways, for example to create permalinks with fully customizable content or to trigger a client Side Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a permalink with a non-string message.</p>
<p>The advisory metadata references the appropriate go pseudo version available from pkg.go.dev</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher that can be exploited in narrow circumstances through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker would need to have control of an expired domain or execute a DNS spoofing/hijacking attack against the domain to exploit this vulnerability. The targeted domain is the one used as the Rancher URL.</p>
<p>SUSE is unaware of any successful exploitation of this vulnerability, which has a high complexity bar. </p>
<p>Please consult the associated  <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK - Technique - Adversary-in-the-Middle</a> for further information about this attack category.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>A new setting, <a href="https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/tls-settings"><code>agent-tls-mode</code></a>, was added, which allows users to specify if agents will use <code>strict</code> certificate verification when connecting to Rancher. The field can be set to <code>strict</code> (which requires the agent to verify the certificate using only the Certificate Authority in the <code>cacerts</code> setting) or <code>system-store</code> (which allows the agent to verify the certificate using any Certificate Authority in the operating system's trust store). This setting will default to strict on new installs of Rancher <code>v2.8.6</code>, <code>v2.9.0</code>, and newer versions. When upgrading from a prior version, the current value will be kept. If updating from older versions, the settings must be manually configured.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For non-Windows nodes, this is fixed since <code>v2.8.6</code> and <code>v2.9.0</code>. For Windows nodes, this is fully fixed starting with <code>v2.8.8</code> and <code>v2.9.2</code></p>
<p>Patched versions include releases <code>v2.8.8</code> and <code>v2.9.2</code>.</p>
<p>For non-Windows nodes, the fix was released with <code>v2.7.15</code>. However, if you are running Rancher <code>v2.7.x</code> and have Windows nodes, you must follow the below workaround to address this issue on those nodes.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If you can't update, please follow the standard security practices including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Properly control the expiration and ownership of the domain used as the Rancher URL (the <code>server-url</code> of the Rancher cluster).</li>
<li>Enabling DNSSEC as a way to protect against DNS spoofing or hijacking attacks. </li>
<li>Properly clean up and decommission unused clusters and downstream clusters, instead of leaving them behind. For example, downstream clusters which are alive while the main Rancher server is no longer available.</li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, Windows nodes added to RKE2 clusters may not be automatically updated with the desired <code>agent-tls-mode</code>. Windows clusters running at least the August patches (<code>v1.27.16</code>, <code>v1.28.13</code>, <code>v1.29.8</code>, <code>v1.30.4</code>) will be automatically updated. For Windows nodes running older versions of RKE2, this issue can be manually resolved by following these <a href="https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>If you are running Rancher <code>v2.7.x</code> Windows nodes will not automatically update, and you must follow the above <a href="https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/windows-agent-strict-verify">instructions</a>, with the following notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>This needs to be done for all existing Windows nodes and any new nodes provisioned.</li>
<li>You must omit the <code>DownloadWins</code> flag, and must instead manually download the <code>rancher-wins</code> version <a href="https://github.com/rancher/wins/releases/tag/v0.4.18">0.4.18</a>, or greater, from its GitHub repository and place it in the required directories:
a. <code>c:\Windows</code>
b. <code>c:\user\local\bin</code></li>
<li>You must restart the nodes after running the script, simply restarting <code>rancher-wins</code> or RKE2 will result in <a href="https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/5551">pod networking errors</a>. The only scenario where you do not need to completely restart the node is if the cluster is running version <code>v1.27.16</code> or higher.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="preconditions">Preconditions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>code</code> login method is enabled with the <code>passwordless_enabled</code> flag set to <code>true</code> .</li>
<li>A 2FA method such as <code>totp</code> is enabled.</li>
<li><code>required_aal</code> of the whomai check or the settings flow is set to <code>highest_available</code>. AAL stands for Authenticator Assurance Levels and can range from 0 (no factor) to 2 (two factors).</li>
<li>A user uses the <code>code</code> method as the <strong>only</strong> login method available. They do not have a password or any other first factor credential enabled.</li>
<li>The user has 2FA enabled.</li>
<li>The user’s <code>available_aal</code> is incorrectly stored in the database as <code>aal1</code> or <code>aal0</code> or <code>NULL</code>.</li>
<li>A user signs in using the code method, but does not complete the 2FA challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example server configuration</strong></p>
<p>Below you will find an vulnerable example configuration. Keep in mind that, for the account to be vulnerable, the account must have no first factor except the <code>code</code> method enabled plus a second factor.</p>
<pre><code>selfservice:
  methods:
    code:
      # The `code` login method is enabled with the `passwordless_enabled` flag set to `true`
      passwordless_enabled: true
    totp:
      # 2FA method such as `totp` is enabled
      enabled: true
  flows:
    settings:
      # This is set
      required_aal: highest_available
session:
  whoami:
    # Or this
    required_aal: highest_available
</code></pre>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>Given the preconditions, the <code>highest_available</code> setting will incorrectly assume that the identity’s highest available AAL is <code>aal1</code> even though it really is <code>aal2</code>. This means that the <code>highest_available</code> configuration will act as if the user has only one factor set up, for that particular user. This means that they can call the settings and whoami endpoint without a <code>aal2</code> session, even though that should be disallowed.</p>
<p>An attacker would need to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user who has only OTP for login enabled and who has an incorrect <code>available_aal</code> value stored, to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>All other aspects of the session (e.g. the session’s aal) are not impacted by this issue.</p>
<p>On Ory Network, only 0,00066% of registered users were affected by this issue, and most of those users appeared to be test users. Their respective AAL values have since been updated and they are no longer vulnerable to this attack.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Version 1.3.0 is not affected by this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If you require 2FA please disable the passwordless code login method. If that is not possible, check the sessions <code>aal</code> to identify if the user has <code>aal1</code> or <code>aal2</code>.</p>

        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-58vj-cv5w-v4v6"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="security-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-navidrome">Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Navidrome</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Navidrome automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This can be exploited to access information by adding parameters like <code>password=...</code> in the URL (ORM Leak).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the names of the parameters are not properly escaped, leading to SQL Injections.</p>
<p>Finally, the username is used in a <code>LIKE</code> statement, allowing people to log in with <code>%</code> instead of their username.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<h3 id="orm-leak">ORM Leak</h3>
<p>When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically included in an SQL <code>LIKE</code> statement (depending on the parameter's name). This allows attackers to potentially retrieve arbitrary information.</p>
<p>For example, attackers can use the following request to test whether some encrypted passwords start with <code>AAA</code>:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/user?_end=36&amp;_order=DESC&amp;password=AAA%
</code></pre>
<p>This results in an SQL query like <code>password LIKE 'AAA%'</code>, allowing attackers to slowly brute-force passwords. (Also, any reason for using encryption instead of hashing?)</p>
<h3 id="sql-injections">SQL Injections</h3>
<p>When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically added to an SQL query. The names of the parameters are not properly escaped.</p>
<p>This behavior can be used to inject arbitrary SQL code (SQL Injection), for example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/album?_end=36&amp;_order=DESC&amp;_sort=recently_added&amp;_start=0&amp;SELECT+*+FROM+USER--=123 HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
<p>This is only an example, but you should see an error message in the logs.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-weakness">Authentication Weakness</h3>
<p>When retrieving the user for authentication, the following code is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (r *userRepository) FindByUsername(username string) (model.User, error) {
    sel := r.newSelect().Columns("").Where(Like{"user_name": username})
    var usr model.User
    err := r.queryOne(sel, &amp;usr)
    return &amp;usr, err
}
</code></pre>
<p>This relies on a <code>LIKE</code> statement and allows users to log in with <code>%</code> instead of the legitimate username.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept-poc">Proof of Concept (PoC)</h2>
<p>See above.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>These vulnerabilities can be used to leak information and dump the contents of the database.</p>

<p>In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access.
Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access.
Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Organization, create new project and setup OpenID connect.</li>
<li>Deactivate an Organization</li>
<li>Setup authentication without selecting Check for Project on Authentication</li>
<li>User is able to login despite the organization is deactivated</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation.</p>
