        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Capsule implements a multi-tenant and policy-based environment in a Kubernetes cluster. A ServiceAccount deployed in a Tenant Namespace, when granted with <code>PATCH</code> capabilities on its own Namespace, is able to edit it and remove the Owner Reference, breaking the reconciliation of the Capsule Operator and removing all the enforcement like Pod Security annotations, Network Policies, Limit Range and Resource Quota items.</p>
<p>With that said, an attacker could detach the Namespace from a Tenant that is forbidding starting privileged Pods using the Pod Security labels by removing the OwnerReference, removing the enforcement labels, and being able to start privileged containers that would be able to start a generic Kubernetes privilege escalation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A request forgery attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker may introduce characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be used to successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server.

</blockquote>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This is fixed in Varnish 6.0.11; Varnish 6.0.11 is available in <code>kube-httpcache</code> versions v0.7.1 and later.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables.</p>
<p><strong>Affected platforms:</strong> All
<strong>Patched Tailscale client versions:</strong> v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h3>
<p>All Tailscale clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?</h3>
<p>Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact">What is the impact?</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.</p>
<p>An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.</p>
