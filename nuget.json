If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>\n<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Framework. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework checks the source markup of a file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discussion\">Discussion</h2>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=Issue-Question&amp;template=Support_Question.md&amp;title=Support+Question\">open a support question</a> to discuss the PowerShell aspects of this advisory.\nPlease use <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\">https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424</a> for discussion of the .NET WPF aspects of this advisory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"affected-software\"><a name=\"affected-software\">Affected Software</a></h2>\n<p>The vulnerability affects PowerShell prior to the following versions:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PowerShell Core Version</th>\n<th>Fixed in</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>6.2</td>\n<td>Not Affected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7.0</td>\n<td>7.0.0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id=\"advisory-faq\">Advisory FAQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-know-if-i-am-affected\">How do I know if I am affected?</h3>\n<p>If all of the following are true:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run <code>pwsh -v</code>, then, check the version in the table in <a href=\"#user-content-affected-software\">Affected Software</a> to see if your version of PowerShell is affected.</li>\n<li>If you are running a version of PowerShell where the executable is not <code>pwsh</code> or <code>pwsh.exe</code>, then you are affected.

Who is impacted?</em>\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>\n<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>\nA scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>\nThe vulnerability has been fixed.
