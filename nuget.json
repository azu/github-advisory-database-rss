This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>\n<h2 id=\"announcement\">Announcement</h2>\n<p>Announcement for this issue can be found at  <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/290\">https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/290</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigation-factors\"><a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors</h3>\n<p>This impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in <a href=\"#affected-software\">affected software</a>. \nOther project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"affected-software\"><a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software</h2>\n<p>This impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of the below project templates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>   ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)</li>\n<li>   ASP.NET Core Web API</li>\n<li>   ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)</li>\n<li>   Blazor Server App</li>\n<li>   Blazor WebAssembly App</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"advisory-faq\">Advisory FAQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-know-if-i-am-affected\"><a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?</h3>\n<p>If you are you using project templates listed in <a href=\"#affected-software\">affected software</a>, you may be exposed to the vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-fix-the-issue\"><a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?</h3>\n<h4 id=\"for-existing-projects\">For existing projects:</h4>\n<p>If you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -&gt; New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/\">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/\">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"for-new-projects\">For new projects:</h4>\n<p>To remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.</li>\n<li>If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.</li>\n<li>If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the <code>dotnet --info</code> command.
