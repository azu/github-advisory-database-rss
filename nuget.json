If the _baseDirectory is not slash terminated like <code>/home/user/dir</code> it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. <code>/home/user/dir.sh</code>.

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</p>\n<p>XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3>\n<p>Releases before version 21.12.22.1 are affected.
