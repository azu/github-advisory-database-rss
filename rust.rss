        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In function <code>Table::as_ref</code>, a reference of vector is force cast to slice. There are multiple problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>To guarantee the size is correct, we have to first do <code>Vec::shrink_to_fit</code>. The function requires a mutable reference, so we have to force cast from immutable to mutable, which is undefined behavior (UB).</li>
<li>Even if (1) is sound, <code>&amp;Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;[T]</code> still might not have the same layout. Treating them equally may lead to undefinted behavior (UB).</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The filesystem glob pattern wildcards <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>[...]</code> match file path literals and leading dots by default, which unintentionally exposes sub folder content of allowed paths.</p>
<p>Example: The <code>fs</code> scope <code>$HOME/*.key</code> would also allow <code>$HOME/.ssh/secret.key</code> to be read even though it is in a sub directory of <code>$HOME</code> and is inside a hidden folder.</p>
<p>Scopes without the wildcards are not affected. As <code>**</code> allows for sub directories the behavior there is also as expected.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The issue has been patched in the latest release and was backported into the currently supported 1.x branches.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>No workaround is known at the time of publication.</p>
<h3 id="references">References</h3>
<p>The original report contained information that the <code>dialog.open</code> component automatically allows one sub directory to be read, regardless of the <code>recursive</code> option.</p>
<p>Imagine a file system looking like</p>
<pre><code> o ../
 o documents/
    - file.txt
    - deeper/
       o deep_file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Reproduction steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trying to load “file.txt” or “deep_file.txt” doesn’t work. Expected</li>
<li>Select “documents” as folder to open(ie. with window.<strong>TAURI</strong>.dialog.open)</li>
<li>Trying to load “file.txt” works. Expected</li>
<li>Trying to load “deep_file.txt” also works, which isn’t expected</li>
</ol>
<p>The recursive flag is used in <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/cd8c074ae6592303d3f6844a4fb6d262eae913b2/core/tauri/src/scope/fs.rs#L154">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/cd8c074ae6592303d3f6844a4fb6d262eae913b2/core/tauri/src/scope/fs.rs#L154</a> to scope the filesystem access to either files in the folder or to also include sub directories.</p>
<p>The original issue was replicated and further investigated.</p>
<p>The root cause was triaged to the <code>glob</code> crate facilitating defaults, which allow the <code>*</code> and <code>[...]</code> to also match path literals.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">MatchOptions {
    case_sensitive: true,
    require_literal_separator: false,
    require_literal_leading_dot: false
}
</code></pre>
<p>This implicated that not only the <code>dialog.open</code> component was affected but rather all <code>fs</code> scopes containing the <code>*</code> or <code>[...]</code> glob.
During this investigation it became obvious that the current glob matches would also match hidden folder (e.g: <code>.ssh</code>) content by default, without explicitly allowing hidden folders to be matched. This is not commonly expected behavior in comparison to for example <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>The new default  Match options are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">MatchOptions {
    case_sensitive: true,
    require_literal_separator: true,
    require_literal_leading_dot: true
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Another note security relevant for developers building applications interacting with case sensitive filesystems is, that the <code>case_sensitive</code> option only affects ASCII file paths and is not valid in Unicode based paths. This is considered a known risk until the <code>glob</code> crate supports non-ASCII file paths for this type of case sensitive matching.</p>

<p>The linux-loader crate used the offsets and sizes provided in the ELF headers to determine the offsets to read from. If those offsets pointed beyond the end of the file this could lead to an infinite loop.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A problem with Candy Machine V2 allow minting NFTs to an arbitrary collection due to a missing check.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the exploit:
Details:
Here is the tx/ix to exploit:
Transaction:
Ix 1: candy_machine v2, mint_nft, passing in empty metadata -1
Ix 2: custom handler, 0
        cpi A --&gt; token_metadata create_metadata_account, creates NFT
        cpi B --&gt; candy_machine v2, set_collection_during_mint
Ix 1 passes our first check for empty metadata, but eventually will hit a bot tax and return Ok.  We do have a CPI check in this function but even if we hit that or moved it to the top, it returns Ok as a bot tax and still enables the issue.
Ix 2, cpi A is Ok and mints an arbitrary NFT.
Ix 2, cpi B checks the previous instruction using index_relative_to_current-1.  This turns out to be Ix 1 which was Ok, so then your newly minted arbitrary NFT is successfully added to the collection.
Conclusion:
Candy machine could be out of NFTs and it still works.  If the CM is closed, (we think?) it doesn't get to the check.
The fix needs to be in set_collection_during_mint that current program ID id candy_machine_v2.  It checks previous program ID but doesn't check current.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS DOES NOT AFFECT Cmv3</p>

<p>Unix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances. This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.</p>
<p>The affected functions from time 0.2.7 through 0.2.22 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at</code></li>
<li><code>time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at</code></li>

<li><code>at_utc</code></li>
<li><code>now</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-Unix targets (including Windows and wasm) are unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>In some versions of <code>time</code>, the internal method that determines the local offset has been modified to always return <code>None</code> on the affected operating systems. This has the effect of returning an <code>Err</code> on the <code>try_*</code> methods and <code>UTC</code> on the non-<code>try_*</code> methods. In later versions, <code>time</code> will attempt to determine the number of threads running in the process. If the process is single-threaded, the call will proceed as its safety invariant is upheld.</p>
<p>Users and library authors with time in their dependency tree must perform <code>cargo update</code>, which will pull in the updated, unaffected code.</p>
<p>Users of time 0.1 do not have a patch and must upgrade to an unaffected version: time 0.2.23 or greater or the 0.3 series.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Library authors must ensure that the program only has one running thread at the time of calling any affected method. Binary authors may do the same and/or ensure that no other thread is actively mutating the environment.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker node can cause a victim node to allocate a large number of small memory chunks, which can ultimately lead to the victim’s process running out of memory and thus getting killed by its operating system. When executed continuously, this can lead to a denial of service attack, especially relevant on a larger scale when run against more than one node of a libp2p based network.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>In the original version of the attack, the malicious node would continuously open new streams on a single connection using a stream multiplexer that doesn’t provide sufficient back pressure (mplex or yamux). While allocations per stream might be considered small, they multiply with the number of streams and connections. It is easy to defend against this one attack, e.g. by setting a strict per connection stream limit and connection limit. But there are other variations of this attack, e.g. causing memory allocations by sending partial payloads on various protocol levels, forcing the victim to buffer the partial payload for a period of time or by tricking the victim into pre-allocating buffers for messages which are never sent by the attacker.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Users are advised to upgrade to <code>libp2p</code> <code>v0.45.1</code> or above.</p>

<p>Users of time 0.1 do not have a patch and must upgrade to an unaffected version: time 0.2.23 or greater or the 0.3 series.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Library authors must ensure that the program only has one running thread at the time of calling any affected method. Binary authors may do the same and/or ensure that no other thread is actively mutating the environment.</p>
