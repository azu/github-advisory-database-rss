        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An issue was discovered in zola 0.13.0 through 0.17.2. The custom implementation of a web server, available via the "zola serve" command, allows directory traversal. The <code>handle_request</code> function, used by the server to process HTTP requests, does not account for sequences of special path control characters (<code>../</code>) in the URL when serving a file, which allows one to escape the webroot of the server and read arbitrary files from the filesystem.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Versions of <code>ed25519-dalek</code> prior to v2.0 model private and public keys as separate types which can be assembled into a <code>Keypair</code>, and also provide APIs for serializing and deserializing 64-byte private/public keypairs.</p>
<p>Such APIs and serializations are inherently unsafe as the public key is one of the inputs used in the deterministic computation of the <code>S</code> part of the signature, but not in the <code>R</code> value. An adversary could somehow use the signing function as an oracle that allows arbitrary public keys as input can obtain two signatures for the same message sharing the same <code>R</code> and only differ on the <code>S</code> part.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when this happens, one can easily extract the private key.</p>
<p>Revised public APIs in v2.0 of <code>ed25519-dalek</code> do NOT allow a decoupled private/public keypair as signing input, except as part of specially labeled "hazmat" APIs which are clearly labeled as being dangerous if misused.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not prevent extracting some malformed packages downloaded from alternate registries. An attacker able to upload packages to an alternate registry could fill the file system when Cargo downloaded the package.</p>
<p>The severity of this vulnerability is "low" for users of alternate registries. Users relying on crates.io are not affected.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>by design</strong> Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.</p>
<h2 id="disk-space-exaustion">Disk space exaustion</h2>
<p>It was discovered that Cargo did not limit the amount of data extracted from compressed archives. An attacker could upload to an alternate registry a specially crafted package that extracts way more data than its size (also known as a "zip bomb"), exhausting the disk space on the machine using Cargo to download the package.</p>
<h2 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h2>
<p>The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it.</p>
<p>Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/master/patches">in the wg-security-response repository</a> for people building their own toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>We recommend users of alternate registries to excercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as the same concerns about build scripts and procedural macros apply here.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>We want to thank Ori Hollander from JFrog Security Research for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security">Rust security policy</a>.</p>
<p>We also want to thank Josh Triplett for developing the fixes, Weihang Lo for developing the tests, and Pietro Albini for writing this advisory. The disclosure was coordinated by Pietro Albini and Josh Stone.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3xp-wfr4-hx87</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3xp-wfr4-hx87"/>
        <updated>2023-08-10T21:50:48.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not respect the umask when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current user.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-38497.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In UNIX-like systems, each file has three sets of permissions: for the user owning the file, for the group owning the file, and for all other local users. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask">umask</a>" is configured on most systems to limit those permissions during file creation, removing dangerous ones. For example, the default umask on macOS and most Linux distributions only allow the user owning a file to write to it, preventing the group owning it or other local users from doing the same.</p>
<p>When a dependency is downloaded by Cargo, its source code has to be extracted on disk to allow the Rust compiler to read as part of the build. To improve performance, this extraction only happens the first time a dependency is used, caching the pre-extracted files for future invocations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was discovered that Cargo did not respect the umask during extraction, and propagated the permissions stored in the crate archive as-is. If an archive contained files writeable by any user on the system (and the system configuration didn't prevent writes through other security measures), another local user on the system could replace or tweak the source code of a dependency, potentially achieving code execution the next time the project is compiled.</p>
<h2 id="affected-versions">Affected Versions</h2>
<p>All Rust versions before 1.71.1 on UNIX-like systems (like macOS and Linux) are affected. Note that additional system-dependent security measures configured on the local system might prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.</p>
<p>Users on Windows and other non-UNIX-like systems are not affected.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>We recommend all users to update to Rust 1.71.1, which will be released later today, as it fixes the vulnerability by respecting the umask when extracting crate archives. If you build your own toolchain, patches for 1.71.0 source tarballs are <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/main/patches/CVE-2023-38497">available here</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent existing cached extractions from being exploitable, the Cargo binary included in Rust 1.71.1 or later will purge the caches it tries to access if they were generated by older Cargo versions.</p>
<p>If you cannot update to Rust 1.71.1, we recommend configuring your system to prevent other local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located in <code>~/.cargo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>chmod go= ~/.cargo
</code></pre>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The implementation of <code>FromMdbValue</code> has several unsoundness issues. First of all, it allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a bool and could make undefined behavior happen with safe function. Secondly, it allows transmuting pointer without taking memory layout into consideration. The details of reproducing the bug are available <a href="https://github.com/vhbit/lmdb-rs/issues/67">here</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.</p>
