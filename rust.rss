        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85"/>
        <updated>2022-10-05T18:24:37.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is a memory safety Issue when using <a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch"><code>patch</code></a> or <a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#merge"><code>merge</code></a> on <code>state</code> and assign the result back to <code>state</code>.
In this case affected versions of Tremor and the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tremor-script">tremor-script crate</a> maintains references to memory that might have been freed already. And these memory regions can be accessed by retrieving the <code>state</code>, e.g. send it over TCP or HTTP. This requires the Tremor server (or any other program using tremor-script) to execute a tremor-script script that uses the mentioned language construct.</p>
<h4 id="details">Details</h4>
<p>If affects the following two tremor-script language constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#merge">Merge</a> where we assign the result back to the target expression
and the expression to be merged needs to reference the <code>event</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>let state = merge state of event end;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch">Patch</a> where we assign the result back to the target expression
and the patch operations used need to reference the <code>event</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>let state = patch state of insert event.key =&gt; event.value end;
</code></pre>
<p>For constructs like this (it does not matter what it references in the expression to be merged or the patch operations) an optimization
was applied to manipulate the target value in-place, instead of cloning it.</p>
<p>Our <code>Value</code> struct, which underpins all event data in <code>tremor-script</code>, is representing strings as borrowed <code>beef::Cow&lt;'lifetime, str&gt;</code>, 
that reference the raw data <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> the event is based upon. We keep this raw byte-array next to the <code>Value</code> structure inside our <code>Event</code> as a self-referential struct,
so we make sure that the structured <code>Value</code> and its references are valid across its whole lifetime.</p>
<p>The optimization was considered safe as long as it was only possible to merge or patch <code>event</code> data or static data.
When <code>state</code> was introduced to <code>tremor-script</code> (in version 0.7.3) a new possibility to keep <code>Value</code> data around for longer than the lifetime of an event emerged.
If <code>event</code> data is merged or patched into <code>state</code> without cloning it first, it can still reference keys or values from
the previous event, which will now be invalid. This allows access to those already freed regions of memory and to get their content out over the wire.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The issue has been patched in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tremor-script/0.11.6">https://crates.io/crates/tremor-script/0.11.6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases/tag/v0.11.6">https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases/tag/v0.11.6</a> via commit <a href="https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/commit/1a2efcdbe68e5e7fd0a05836ac32d2cde78a0b2e">1a2efcd</a> by removing the optimization
and always clone the target expression of a <a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#merge">Merge</a> or [Patch](<a href="https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch">https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch</a>.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If an upgrade is not possible, a possible workaround is to avoid the optimization
by introducing a temporary variable and not immediately reassigning to <code>state</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let tmp = merge state of event end;
let state = tmp
</code></pre>

<p>When matrix-rust-sdk before 0.6 requests a room key from our devices, it correctly accepts key forwards only if they are a response to a previous request. However, it doesn't check that the device that responded matches the device the key was requested from.</p>
<p>This allows a malicious homeserver to insert room keys of questionable validity into the key store in some situations, potentially assisting in an impersonation attack. Note that even if key injection succeeds in this way, all forwarded keys have the <code>imported</code> flag set, which is used as an indicator that such keys have lesser authentication properties (and should be marked as such in clients, e.g. with a grey shield besides the message).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Previously, the worst case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases. In case of large EVM gas refunds, this can lead to block spamming attacks -- the adversary can construct blocks with transactions that have large amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as a result inflate up the chain gas prices. This issue is fixed by properly refund unused weights after each EVM execution.</p>
<p>The impact of this issue is limited in that the spamming attack would still be costly for any adversary, and it has no ability to alter any chain state. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This vulnerability was reported to the personnummer team in June 2020. The slow response was due to locked ownership of some of the affected packages, which caused delays to update packages prior to disclosure.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is determined to be low severity.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer to be a <em>real</em> personnummer.  </p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions should be updated to as soon as possible:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qv8q-v995-72gr">C#</a> 3.0.2<br>D 3.0.1<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm">Dart</a> 3.0.3<br>Elixir 3.0.0<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hv53-vf5m-8q94">Go</a> 3.0.1<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q3vw-4jx3-rrr2">Java</a> 3.3.0<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpgc-7h78-gx8f">JavaScript</a> 3.1.0<br>Kotlin 1.1.0<br>Lua 3.0.1<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p6g-gjp8-ggg9">PHP</a> 3.0.2<br>Perl 3.0.0<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxq3-5249-8hgg">Python</a> 3.0.2<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp9c-fpxx-744v">Ruby</a> 3.0.1<br><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28r9-pq4c-wp3c">Rust</a> 3.0.0<br>Scala 3.0.1<br>Swift 1.0.1  </p>
<p>If you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the personnummer to be
000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not
000x.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The issue lies in the implementation of the <code>cell_project</code> macro which used <code>field as *const _</code> instead of <code>field as *mut _</code>.
The problem being that <code>*const T</code> is covariant in <code>T</code> while <code>*mut T</code> is invariant in <code>T</code>. Keep in mind that <code>&amp;Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> is invariant in <code>T</code>,
so casting to <code>*const T</code> relaxed the variance, and lead to unsoundness, as shown in the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">use std::cell::Cell;
use cell_project::cell_project as cp;

struct Foo&lt;'a&gt; {
    x: Option&lt;&amp;'a Cell&lt;Foo&lt;'a&gt;&gt;&gt;,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; Drop for Foo&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        // `ourselves` is an &amp;Cell&lt;Self&gt;.
        // NB: `Drop` is unsound.
        if let Some(ourselves) = self.x.as_ref() {
            // replace `self` (but this doesn't actually replace `self`)
            let is_x_none = ourselves.replace(Foo {
                x: None,
            }).x.as_ref().is_none();
            // if we just moved out of `self`, and we had a `Some` originally,
            // how come this is a `None`?
            if is_x_none {
                println!("how did we get a None?");
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Cell::new(Foo {
        x: None,
    });
    let x = cp!(Foo&lt;'_&gt;, foo.x);
    x.set(Some(&amp;foo));

<h2 id="affected-versions">Affected Versions</h2>
<p>All versions of the cell-project crate before <code>0.1.4</code> are affected.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
<p>This was fixed in <a href="https://github.com/RustyYato/cell-project/issues/4">Issues/4</a>, and released as version <code>0.1.4</code>.
So just updating to the latest version will include the fix (which may result in a compile error on unsound usage).</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This was discovered and fixed by @SoniEx2 in cell-project: <a href="https://github.com/RustyYato/cell-project/issues/3">Issues/3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustyYato/cell-project/issues/4">Issues/4</a></p>

<p>Affected versions of <code>mozjpeg</code> crate allow creating instances of any type <code>T</code> from bytes,
and do not correctly constrain <code>T</code> to the types for which it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Examples of safety violation possible for a type <code>T</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>T</code> contains a reference type, and it constructs a pointer to an invalid, arbitrary memory address.</li>
<li><code>T</code> requires a safety and/or validity invariant for its construction that may be violated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue was fixed in 0.8.19 by using safer types and involving <code>rgb</code> dependency bump.</p>

That meant if a malicious peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of memory and crash. This also applies to these extractors which used Bytes::from_request internally: axum::extract::Form axum::extract::Json String</p>

<p>Due to missing canonicalization when <code>readDir</code> is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined <code>fs</code> scope.

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"/>
        <updated>2022-09-16T17:41:34.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the <code>Heap</code> and <code>LockedHeap</code> types, including <code>Heap::new</code>, <code>Heap::init</code>, <code>Heap::init_from_slice</code>, and <code>LockedHeap::new</code>. It also affects multiple uses of the <code>Heap::extend</code> method.</p>
<h3 id="initialization-functions">Initialization Functions</h3>
<p>The heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to <strong><em>out-of-bound writes</em></strong> when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than <code>3 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code> because of metadata write operations.</p>
<h3 id="heapextend"><code>Heap::extend</code></h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts three specific uses of the <code>Heap::extend</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>When calling <code>Heap::extend</code> with a size smaller than two <code>usize</code>s (e.g., 16 on <code>x86_64</code>), the size was erroneously rounded up to the minimum size, which could result in an <strong><em>out-of-bounds write</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Calling <code>Heap::extend</code> on an empty heap tried to construct a heap starting at address 0, which is also an <strong><em>out-of-bounds write</em></strong>.<ul>
<li>One specific way to trigger this accidentally is to call <code>Heap::new</code> (or a similar constructor) with a heap size that is smaller than two <code>usize</code>s. This was treated as an empty heap as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calling <code>Heap::extend</code> on a heap whose size is not a multiple of the size of two <code>usize</code>s resulted in <em>unaligned writes</em>. It also left the heap in an unexpected state, which might lead to subsequent issues. We did not find a way to exploit this undefined behavior yet (apart from DoS on platforms that fault on unaligned writes).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="patches">Patches</h2>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>
<p>We published a patch in version <code>0.10.2</code> and recommend all users to upgrade to it. This patch release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initialization functions now panic if the given size is not large enough to store the necessary metadata. Depending on the alignment of the heap bottom pointer, the minimum size is between <code>2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code> and <code>3 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>extend</code> method now panics when trying to extend an unitialized heap.</li>
<li>Extend calls with a size smaller than <code>size_of::&lt;usize&gt;() * 2</code> are now buffered internally and not added to the list directly. The buffered region will be merged with future <code>extend</code> calls.</li>
<li>The <code>size()</code> method now returns the <em>usable</em> size of the heap, which might be slightly smaller than the <code>top() - bottom()</code> difference because of alignment constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>
<p>To avoid this issue, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than <code>3 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code> and that the <code>Heap::extend</code> method is only called with sizes larger than <code>2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of <code>2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>.</p>

        <updated>2022-09-21T19:53:21.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not prevent extracting some malformed packages downloaded from alternate registries. An attacker able to upload packages to an alternate registry could corrupt arbitary files when Cargo downloaded the package.</p>
<p>The severity of this vulnerability is "low" for users of alternate registries. Users relying on crates.io are not affected.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>by design</strong> Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.</p>
<h2 id="arbitrary-file-corruption">Arbitrary file corruption</h2>
<p>After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the <code>~/.cargo</code> folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successfull, Cargo writes "ok" to the <code>.cargo-ok</code> file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files.</p>
<p>It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a <code>.cargo-ok</code> <em>symbolic link</em>, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write "ok" into <code>.cargo-ok</code>, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with <code>ok</code>. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package.</p>
<h2 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h2>
<p>The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it.</p>
<p>Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/master/patches">in the wg-security-response repository</a> for people building their own toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>We recommend users of alternate registries to excercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.</p>
