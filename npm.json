Vite statically replaces these values in production builds. This reduces the amount of affected applications to a very small amount of affected applications.</p>\n<p>To verify if you are affected you can search for the private key value or the <code>TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY</code> variable inside the release build frontend assets (<code>dist/</code>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: <code>grep -r \"TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY\" dist/</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using only the <code>envPrefix: ['VITE_'],</code> or any other framework than Vite means you are not impacted by this advisory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The documentation has been patched but as the root cause is not in Tauri itself the issue is not fixed by updating Tauri.\nThe <code>vite.config.ts</code> configuration of the project needs to be adapted.</p>\n<p>We recommend rotating your updater private key if you are affected by this (requires Tauri CLI &gt;=1.5.5). After updating the envPrefix configuration, generate a new private key with <code>tauri signer generate</code>, saving the new private key and updating the updater's <code>pubkey</code> value on <code>tauri.conf.json</code> with the new public key. To update your existing application, the next application build must be signed with the older private key in order to be accepted by the existing application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>The <code>envPrefix: ['VITE_'],</code>should be used and the desired <code>TAURI</code> variables manually added.\nRespective these variables could be added <code>TAURI_PLATFORM</code>, <code>TAURI_ARCH</code>, <code>TAURI_FAMILY</code>, <code>TAURI_PLATFORM_VERSION</code>, <code>TAURI_PLATFORM_TYPE</code> and <code>TAURI_DEBUG</code> without leaking sensitive information.</p>\n<p>We urge affected users to implement the workaround as the <code>1.x</code> branch will not receive a general prevention fix as it would break systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>The issue was originally disclosed in our discord <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1164260301655523409\">here</a>.\nThe affected guide is <a href=\"https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/\">https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Update: We lowered the severity from high to low, as the likelihood of impact was found to only affect a <strong>very limited</strong> amount of applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-2rcp-jvr4-r259\">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-2rcp-jvr4-r259</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46115\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46115</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/8b166e9bf82e69ddb3200a3a825614980bd8d433\">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/8b166e9bf82e69ddb3200a3a825614980bd8d433</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1164260301655523409\">https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1164260301655523409</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/\">https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2rcp-jvr4-r259\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2rcp-jvr4-r259</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>It seems that any Directus installation that has websockets enabled can be crashed if the websocket server receives an invalid frame. This could probably be posted as an issue and I might even be able to put together a pull request for a fix (if only I had some extra time...), but I decided to instead post as a vulnerability just for the maintainers, since this seemingly can be used to crash any live Directus server if websockets are enabled, so public disclosure is not a good idea until the issue is fixed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>The fix for this seems quite simple; the websocket server just needs to properly catch the error instead of crashing the server. See for example: <a href=\"https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2098\">https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2098</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start a fresh Directus server (using for example the compose file here: <a href=\"https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/docker-guide.html\">https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/docker-guide.html</a>). Enable websockets by setting <code>WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED: 'true'</code> environment variable.</li>\n<li>run a separate node app somewhere else to send an invalid frame to the server:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const WebSocket = require(\"ws\");\nconst websocket = new WebSocket(\"ws://0.0.0.0:8055/websocket\");\nwebsocket.on(\"open\", function () {\n  const chunk = Buffer.from(\"a180\", \"hex\");\n  websocket._socket.write(chunk);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The server crashes with an error: <code>RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear</code>. Server needs to be manually restarted to get back online (if there's no recovery mechanism in place, as there often isn't with simple node servers). This was confirmed on a local server, and additionally I was able to crash our staging server with the same code, just pointing to our staging Directus server running at fly.io. It seems to also crash servers running in the <a href=\"https://directus.cloud\">directus.cloud</a> service. I created <a href=\"https://websocket-test.directus.app/\">https://websocket-test.directus.app/</a>, pointed the above script to the websocket url of that instance and the server does crash for a while. It seems that in there there's a mechanism for bringing the server back up quite fast, but it would be quite trivial for anyone to DoS any server running in directus.cloud by just spamming these invalid frames to the server. </p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-hmgw-9jrg-hf2m\">https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-hmgw-9jrg-hf2m</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/243eed781b42d6b4948ddb8c3792bcf5b44f55bb\">https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/243eed781b42d6b4948ddb8c3792bcf5b44f55bb</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v10.6.2\">https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v10.6.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45820\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45820</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hmgw-9jrg-hf2m\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hmgw-9jrg-hf2m</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
