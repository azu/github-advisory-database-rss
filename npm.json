In versions 0.55.0 and prior (corresponding to <code>@scrypted/core</code> 0.1.142 and prior), a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the login page via the <code>redirect_uri</code> parameter. By specifying a url with the javascript scheme (<code>javascript:</code>), an attacker can run arbitrary JavaScript code after the login. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47623\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47623</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/koush/scrypted/blob/v0.55.0/plugins/core/ui/src/Login.vue#L79\">https://github.com/koush/scrypted/blob/v0.55.0/plugins/core/ui/src/Login.vue#L79</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-218_GHSL-2023-219_scrypted\">https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-218_GHSL-2023-219_scrypted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ww7p-8gfg-v82r\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ww7p-8gfg-v82r</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
