After the trials limit was reached, the login form immediately blocked further requests for existing users, but not for invalid users.</p>\n<p>This exploit does not scale to brute force attacks because of the delay during the first 10 requests per user, the faint difference between the responses for valid and invalid users and the fact that code-based logins would send an email for every login attempt, which makes the attack easy to spot. The vulnerability is therefore only relevant for targeted attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The problem has been patched in <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2\">Kirby 3.5.8.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2\">Kirby 3.6.6.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1\">Kirby 3.7.5.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1\">Kirby 3.8.1</a>.
