The exact security risk depends on the field type and usage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Kirby stores content of the site, of pages, files and users in text files by default. The text files use Kirby's KirbyData format where each field is separated by newlines and a line with four dashes (<code>----</code>).</p>\n<p>When reading a KirbyData file, the affected code first removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards split the content into fields by the field separator.</p>\n<p>When writing to a KirbyData file, field separators in field data are escaped to prevent user input from interfering with the field structure. However this escaping could be tricked by including a Unicode BOM sequence in a field separator (e.g. <code>--\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF--</code>). When writing, this was not detected as a separator, but during the read process the BOM was removed, turning the malicious line into a valid separator. This could be abused by attackers to inject other field data into content files.</p>\n<p>Because each field can only be defined once per content file, this vulnerability only affects fields in the content file that were defined above the vulnerable user-writable field or not at all. Fields that are defined below the vulnerable field override the injected field content and were therefore already protected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The problem has been patched in <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3\">Kirby 3.5.8.3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3\">Kirby 3.6.6.3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2\">Kirby 3.7.5.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1\">Kirby 3.8.4.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6\">Kirby 3.9.6</a>. Please update to one of these or a <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases\">later version</a> to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>In all of the mentioned releases, we have fixed the affected code to only remove the Unicode BOM sequence at the beginning of the file. This fixes this vulnerability both for newly written as well as for existing content files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Patrick Falb (@dapatrese) at <a href=\"https://former03.de/\">FORMER 03</a> for responsibly reporting the identified issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38488\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38488</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/a1e0f81c799ddae1af91cf37216f8ded9cb93540\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/a1e0f81c799ddae1af91cf37216f8ded9cb93540</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The Kirby core does not use any of the affected methods.</p>\n<p>If you use an affected method and cannot rule out XML input controlled by an attacker, we strongly recommend to update to a patch release.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>XML External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the XML markup language that allows to include data from external files in an XML structure. If the name of the external file can be controlled by an attacker, this becomes a vulnerability that can be abused for various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to perform network requests on behalf of the server (server-side request forgery, SSRF).</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Kirby's <code>Xml::parse()</code> method used PHP's <code>LIBXML_NOENT</code> constant, which enabled the processing of XML external entities during the parsing operation.</p>\n<p>The <code>Xml::parse()</code> method is used in the <code>Xml</code> data handler (e.g. <code>Data::decode($string, 'xml')</code>).</p>\n<p>Both the vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the Kirby core. However they may be used in site or plugin code, e.g. to parse RSS feeds or other XML files.

If those files are of an external origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from an external URL), attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML file that will then be processed in the parsing process.</p>\n<p>Kirby sites that don't use XML parsing in site or plugin code are <em>not</em> affected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The problem has been patched in <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3\">Kirby 3.5.8.3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3\">Kirby 3.6.6.3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2\">Kirby 3.7.5.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1\">Kirby 3.8.4.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6\">Kirby 3.9.6</a>. Please update to one of these or a <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases\">later version</a> to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>In all of the mentioned releases, we have removed the <code>LIBXML_NOENT</code> constant as processing of external entities is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses of the method against the described vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Alexandre Zanni (@noraj) at <a href=\"https://www.acceis.fr/\">ACCEIS</a> and Patrick Falb (@dapatrese) at <a href=\"https://former03.de/\">FORMER 03</a> for responsibly reporting the identified issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38490\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38490</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/277b05662d2b67386f0a0f18323cf68b30e86387\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/277b05662d2b67386f0a0f18323cf68b30e86387</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
