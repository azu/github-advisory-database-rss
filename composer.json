            "content_html": "<p>namshi/jose allows the acceptance of unsecure JSON Web Signatures (JWS) by default. The vulnerability arises from the $allowUnsecure flag, which, when set to true during the loading of JWSes, permits tokens signed with 'none' algorithms to be processed. This behavior poses a significant security risk as it could allow an attacker to impersonate users by crafting a valid jwt token.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/namshi/jose/commit/009f86d6ced000b806b2f602c0b7393060ebb34e\">https://github.com/namshi/jose/commit/009f86d6ced000b806b2f602c0b7393060ebb34e</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/namshi/jose/2015-02-19.yaml\">https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/namshi/jose/2015-02-19.yaml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxhc-wmg8-xrqf\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxhc-wmg8-xrqf</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
