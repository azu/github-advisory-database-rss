            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>SAML messages are usually signed to prove the identity of the issuer of the message. In the case of SAML authentication responses, correctly verifying the signature is critical to trust that the assertion contained inside the response was issued by a trusted third-party and the identity of the subject has been properly verified.</p>\n<p>A SAML message can be signed both at the message level and at the assertion level (if the message is an authentication response). When the whole authentication response message is unsigned, all the assertions contained inside must be signed independently in order to verify their authenticity. Failure to properly verify the authenticity of the entire message or individual assertions leads to the ability of an attacker to impersonate any user from any Identity Provider trusted by the Service Provider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>A signature validation bypass issue has been found in the <code>SimpleSAML_XML_Validator</code> class. This class performs the verification of the XML digital signature of a SAML 1 message with a given key.</p>\n<p>When a SAML 1 authentication response message is received, it is processed to verify its authenticity, including a check for the signature or signatures included in the message. If the message is not signed but the assertions contained in it are, the signatures of those assertions signed will be verified. Unsigned assertions will not be verified. After verifying every signed element in the response, a list of valid nodes is built, holding the DOM nodes of those XML elements that are signed and whose signatures have been successfully verified.</p>\n<p>Once this list is built, the assertions need to be processed individually. They are not processed until the getAttributes() method of the SimpleSAML_XML_Shib13_AuthnResponse class is called. This method iterates through the list of assertions contained in the response and makes sure they were validated in the previous signature verification step, by checking if their corresponding DOM nodes are in the list of those verified.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability is due to lax comparison of the node being checked and the nodes in the verified list. The isNodeValidated() method of the SimpleSAML_XML_Validator class checks if a given DOM node is in the validNodes array by means of the standard in_array() function. This function, however, will return unexpected results due to the default lax behaviour when checking data types in PHP. In this case, the fact that there is a DOM node in the list is enough for in_array() to return true when looking for any DOM node. This means any unsigned assertion will be considered verified if there is at least one assertion with a valid signature in the message being processed.</p>\n<p>This issue allows an attacker to generate a SAML 1 authentication response that contains two different assertions. The first assertion is the one the attacker wants the Service Provider to use, with custom attributes, expiration and even entityID (provided that the given entityID belongs to an Identity Provider that the Service Provider knows and trusts). The second is a legitimate assertion issued and signed by an Identity Provider trusted by the Service Provider. If the second assertion is still valid when sent by the attacker, SimpleSAMLphp will merge all the attributes found in both assertions, but the entityID registered for the authenticating third-party will be the one found in the first, tampered assertion. If the second (legitimate) assertion is already expired when the attacker sends it, only the attributes found in the tampered assertion will be used.</p>\n<p>The issue can be easily fixed by passing a third parameter to the in_array() function, telling it to perform strict comparisons when checking if an object is found inside a given array. This way, when the code evaluates if the tampered assertion is included in the list of verified assertions, it fails and only the legitimate assertion is used, if possible (e.g. it is not expired).</p>\n<h3 id=\"affected-versions\">Affected versions</h3>\n<p>All SimpleSAMLphp versions before and including 1.14.16.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to impersonate any user from any SAML 1 Identity Provider trusted by a SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider, with the only pre-requisite of a valid assertion previously sent to the affected Service Provider. As such, only those SimpleSAMLphp installations that have metadata deployed for SAML 1 Identity Providers (by default, listed in the metadata/shib13-idp-remote.php file, but could be in other locations depending on your local configuration) are affected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resolution\">Resolution</h3>\n<p>Upgrade to the latest version.

This, however, led to the credentials being recorded in the user’s session, which can be stored in permanent storage such as the local file system or a remote memcache or database server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>When an authentication request is received via the ECP profile, the username and password obtained this way were saved to the state array, which is used to pass relevant data to different routines that may need it. This is not a problem in itself. However, when the ECP profile is disabled in the Identity Provider, other bindings such as HTTP-POST or HTTP-Redirect will be used, and since redirections are involved, the state array is then persisted to the user’s session, effectively storing it in the session backend.</p>\n<p>The ECP profile, which uses the SOAP and PAOS bindings, does not involve any HTTP redirection for the user, and for that reason the state array containing the credentials is never persisted to the session. The logic for determining when to save the credentials to the state array assumed wrongly, though, that if the authentication request came in on the SOAP binding, that means the ECP profile is used. This may not be true as ECP can be disabled by configuration in the IdP’s hosted SAML metadata, and in that case SimpleSAMLphp would then try to default to a binding different than PAOS, such as HTTP-POST or HTTP-Redirect, effectively consolidating the entire state array to the user’s session as described before.</p>\n<p>In practice, any Identity Provider with the ECP profile disabled but metadata for an entity that supports ECP, would reject incoming ECP requests, but write the credentials obtained in the request to the user’s session, which will be stored in the session store, whichever is used (local file system in case PHP sessions are used, Memcache, Redis, relational databases, etc).</p>\n<h3 id=\"affected-versions\">Affected versions</h3>\n<p>All SimpleSAMLphp versions 1.16.x are affected, up to 1.16.2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An Identity Provider with metadata for trusted entities that support the SAML ECP profile, may end up storing the user’s credentials received from such entities in its own session storage, whatever that is, in case ECP is actually not enabled in the IdP. Under such circumstances, the credentials may be then accessible to administrators, other personnel or even malicious parties who may have access to the systems where sessions or their backups are stored.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/commit/44d1e3052930d93f0f554c25bc7c7602f8136880\">https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/commit/44d1e3052930d93f0f554c25bc7c7602f8136880</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/2018-12-20.yaml\">https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/2018-12-20.yaml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://simplesamlphp.org/security/201812-01\">https://simplesamlphp.org/security/201812-01</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7wh8-jrq7-p27f\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7wh8-jrq7-p27f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Now the system config option <code>content.safe_mode</code> (enabled by default) controls whether HTML tags and potentially dangerous links are escaped. This is configurable as in some cases more flexibility should be given. Panel users should be only a controlled group of editors, which cannot enable the option by themselves, and not a generic group. This mitigates the chance of introducing vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/6adc302f5a294f2ffbbf1571dd4ffea6b7876723\"><strong>Formwork 2.x</strong> (6adc302)</a> adds a similar <code>content.safeMode</code> system option. Like Formwork 1.13.0, by default HTML tags and dangerous link are escaped. Even if enabled by an administrator, however, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and other dangerous tags are still converted to text, but secure tags are allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35621\">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35621</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gx8m-f3mp-fg99\">https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gx8m-f3mp-fg99</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/2d92e6dbf99a9a49797947afbda0cdd4e56e11df\">https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/2d92e6dbf99a9a49797947afbda0cdd4e56e11df</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/6adc302f5a294f2ffbbf1571dd4ffea6b7876723\">https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/6adc302f5a294f2ffbbf1571dd4ffea6b7876723</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gx8m-f3mp-fg99\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gx8m-f3mp-fg99</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
