            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The phpCAS library uses HTTP headers to determine the service URL used to validate tickets. This allows an attacker to control the host header and use a valid ticket granted for any authorized service in the same SSO realm (CAS server) to authenticate to the service protected by phpCAS. \nDepending on the settings of the CAS server service registry in worst case this may be any other service URL (if the allowed URLs are configured to \"^(https)://.*\") or may be strictly limited to known and authorized services in the same SSO federation if proper URL service validation is applied.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain access to a victim's account on a vulnerable CASified service without victim's knowledge, when the victim visits attacker's website while being logged in to the same CAS server. </p>\n<h3 id=\"patch\">Patch</h3>\n<p>phpCAS 1.6.0 is a major version upgrade that starts enforcing service URL discovery validation, because there is unfortunately no 100% safe default config to use in PHP. Starting this version, it is required to pass in an additional service base URL argument when constructing the client class.</p>\n<p>For more information, please refer to the upgrading doc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability only impacts the CAS client that the phpCAS library protects against. The problematic service URL discovery behavior in phpCAS &lt; 1.6.0 will only be disabled, and thus you are not impacted from it, if the phpCAS configuration has the following setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>phpCAS::setUrl()</code> is called (a reminder that you have to pass in the full URL of the current page, rather than your service base URL), and</li>\n<li><code>phpCAS::setCallbackURL()</code> is called, only when the proxy mode is enabled.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if your PHP's HTTP header input <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Server</code>, <code>Host</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Protocol</code> is sanitized before reaching PHP (by a reverse proxy, for example), you will not be impacted by this vulnerability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Otherwise, you should upgrade the library to get the safe service discovery behavior.</p>\n<p>If your CAS server service registry is configured to only allow known and trusted service URLs, the severity of the vulnerability is reduced substantially since an attacker must be in control of another authorized service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgement\">Acknowledgement</h3>\n<p>We would like to thank Filip Hejsek for discovering this vulnerability, responsibly reporting it to the developers, and helping harden the patch.</p>\n<p>Henry Pan and Joachim Fritschi helped with the patch and release effort as phpCAS developers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/security/advisories/GHSA-8q72-6qq8-xv64\">https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/security/advisories/GHSA-8q72-6qq8-xv64</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/commit/b759361d904a2cb2a3bcee9411fc348cfde5d163\">https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/commit/b759361d904a2cb2a3bcee9411fc348cfde5d163</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/releases/tag/1.6.0\">https://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/releases/tag/1.6.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39369\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39369</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q72-6qq8-xv64\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q72-6qq8-xv64</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be exploited for targeted attacks because the attack does not scale to brute force.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>User enumeration is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation. This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.</p>\n<p>User enumeration attacks are performed by entering an existing and a non-existing user into the email address field of the login form. If the system returns a different response or behaves differently depending on whether the user exists, the attacker can enter unknown email addresses and use the different behavior as a clue for the (non-)existing user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection. By default, it will prevent further login attempts after 10 failed logins from a single IP address or of a single existing user. After every failed login attempt, Kirby inserts a random delay between one millisecond and two seconds to make automated attacks harder and to avoid leaking whether the user exists. Unfortunately, this random delay was not inserted after the brute force limit was reached.</p>\n<p>Because Kirby only tracks failed login attempts per email address for existing users but always tracks failed login attempts per IP address, this behavior could be abused by attackers for user enumeration. For this to work, an attacker would need to create login requests beyond the trials limit (which is 10 by default) from two or more IP addresses. After the trials limit was reached, the login form immediately blocked further requests for existing users, but not for invalid users.</p>\n<p>This exploit does not scale to brute force attacks because of the delay during the first 10 requests per user, the faint difference between the responses for valid and invalid users and the fact that code-based logins would send an email for every login attempt, which makes the attack easy to spot. The vulnerability is therefore only relevant for targeted attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The problem has been patched in <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2\">Kirby 3.5.8.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2\">Kirby 3.6.6.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1\">Kirby 3.7.5.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1\">Kirby 3.8.1</a>. Please update to one of these or a <a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases\">later version</a> to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>In all of the mentioned releases, we have rewritten the affected code so that the delay is also inserted after the brute force limit is reached.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39315\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39315</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
