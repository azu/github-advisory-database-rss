Combined with the fact that profiles are imported as a PHP serialized string, it makes your application vulnerable to code injection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resolution\">Resolution</h3>\n<p>As the import/export feature of the Web Profiler is not that useful, and because PHP <code>serialize/unserialize</code> functions have a long history of vulnerabilities, I decided to remove this feature from the Web interface and move it as CLI commands.</p>\n<p>If you were relying on this feature, you now need to use the <code>profiler:import</code> and <code>profiler:export</code> Symfony commands provided by the WebProfiler bundle from the command line interface.</p>\n<p>Those commands are not enabled by default and must be activated explicitly. For Symfony 2.4+, you can import them in your <code>app/config.yml</code> configuration file:</p>\n<pre><code>import:\n   - { resource: \"%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Bundle/WebProfilerBundle/Resources/config/commands.xml\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>For Symfony 2.3, you can use the following snippet of code in <code>app/console</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$kernel = new AppKernel($env, $debug);\n$application = new Application($kernel);\nif ($kernel-&gt;getContainer()-&gt;has('profiler')) {\n    $profiler = $kernel-&gt;getContainer()-&gt;get('profiler');\n    $application-&gt;add(new ImportCommand($profiler));\n    $application-&gt;add(new ExportCommand($profiler));\n}\n$application-&gt;run($input);\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, I want to reiterate that you should never enable the Symfony Web Profiler on your production servers as this is a development tool. And if you need to enable it, double-check that it is properly secured.</p>\n<p>The patch for this issue is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11832\">https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11832</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11832\">https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11832</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/f38536ab79058f6a934426c41170256ba9623a02\">https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/f38536ab79058f6a934426c41170256ba9623a02</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/symfony/web-profiler-bundle/commit/5b589ba83faf7eb20cec50725cd657075aebdd36\">https://github.com/symfony/web-profiler-bundle/commit/5b589ba83faf7eb20cec50725cd657075aebdd36</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/symfony/CVE-2014-6072.yaml\">https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/symfony/CVE-2014-6072.yaml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/web-profiler-bundle/CVE-2014-6072.yaml\">https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/web-profiler-bundle/CVE-2014-6072.yaml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://symfony.com/cve-2014-6072\">https://symfony.com/cve-2014-6072</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v35g-4rrw-h4fw\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v35g-4rrw-h4fw</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
