It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.</p>\n<p>If CSP were configurable, the website creator could harden it accordingly to the needs of the application.</p>\n<p>As this issue correlates with the Github issue for exposing the flask application directly (<a href=\"https://github.com/onionshare/\">https://github.com/onionshare/</a> onionshare/issues/1389), it can be assumed that this can be solved by either changing to a well-known webserver, which supports this kind of configuration, or enhancing the status quo by making the CSP a configurable part of each website.</p>\n<p>We believe that bundling the nginx or apache webserver would add complexity and dependencies to the application that could result in a larger attack surface - as these packages receive regular security updates. On the other hand it is not recommended to directly expose the flask webserver, due to lack of hardening. This is a trade-off which needs to be evaluated by the Onionshare developers, as multiple features are involved. Ideally the application user could choose between the built-in flask webserver or a system webserver of choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact:</h2>\n<p>As this is a general weakness and not a direct vulnerability in the Onionshare application, the direct impact of this issue is rather low.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recommendation\">Recommendation:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider offering a configurable webserver choice</li>\n<li>Consider configurable CSP</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h\">https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5\">https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21694\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21694</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/1389\">https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/1389</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Eve seemingly leaves the chatroom, which leads Bob and Alice to believe they are having a private chat. The last screenshot shows that Eve only emitted the leave message and is still able to read the chat and possibly write messages.</p>\n<p>This can be reproduced by joining the chat with two different instances, where one instance has slightly modified the client-side JavaScript code similar to OTF-003 (page 22).

            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"description\">Description</h1>\n<p>In versions previous to 2.40.0, Azure CLI contains a vulnerability for potential code injection. Critical scenarios are where a hosting machine runs an Azure CLI command where parameter values have been provided by an external source. </p>\n<p>For example: Application X is a web application with a feature that allows users to create Secrets in an Azure KeyVault. Instead of constructing API calls based on user input, Application X uses Azure CLI commands to create the secrets. Application X has input fields presented to the user and the Azure CLI command parameter values are filled based on the user input fields. This input, when formed correctly, could potentially be run as system commands. Below is an example of the resulting Azure CLI command run on the web app's hosting machine. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value \"abc123|whoami\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above command could potentially run the <code>whoami</code> command on the hosting machine.</p>\n<p>Interactive, in-terminal use and automation/pipeline scenarios have not been identified as critical risk scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"code-injection-prerequisites\">Code injection prerequisites</h2>\n<p>The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows machine <strong><em>and</em></strong> with any version of PowerShell **<em>and</em>**when the parameter value contains the <code>&amp;</code> or <code>|</code> symbols. If any of these prerequisites are not met, this vulnerability is not applicable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-the-command-has-to-be-run-on-windows\">1. The command has to be run on Windows</h3>\n<p>The Azure CLI has an entry script that, when run on Windows, calls cmd.exe to then call Python. This leads into the next prerequisite.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-the-command-has-to-be-executed-by-powershell\">2. The command has to be executed by PowerShell.</h3>\n<p>PowerShell has input parsing designs that strip out the quotation marks of input with the expectation that it will be taken as a string. When used in a PowerShell environment, the command is input like the above command. However, when it passes through PowerShell into cmd.exe, it looks like the following. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-powershell\">az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value abc123|whoami\n</code></pre>\n<p>This leads to the 3rd prerequisite as it won’t just try to run any parameter value as a command. </p>\n<h3 id=\"3-the-parameter-value-has-to-contain-a--or--symbols\">3. The parameter value has to contain a <code>&amp;</code> or <code>|</code> symbols</h3>\n<p>In cmd.exe, the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> symbols invoke command execution. When a string containing this symbols is passed directly to cmd.exe, quotes are kept and command execution is invoked. However, When a string is passed into PowerShell, the quotes are stripped and passed into cmd.exe making it open to execution.</p>\n<p>So, in the <code>keyvault</code> example above, the <code>abc123</code> portion of the value will be accepted correctly but the value after the <code>|</code> symbol will be interpreted as a command. </p>\n<h1 id=\"impact\">Impact</h1>\n<h2 id=\"code-injection\">Code injection</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the above scenario where the value is being provided by and outside source to run an Azure CLI command, system commands or even scripts could be run on a hosting machine. </p>\n<h1 id=\"patches\">Patches</h1>\n<p>Upgrade to Azure CLI 2.40.0 or greater. </p>\n<p>As of Azure CLI 2.40.0, a new .ps1 entry script is used as the entry point to call Python rather than cmd.exe. This removes the opportunity for cmd.exe to interpret input as a command invocation. Using this approach has introduced new issues however that you can read about in the \"More information\" section.</p>\n<p>Upgrade to 2.41.0 or greater and manually call the azps.ps1 entry script in identified critical scenarios.</p>\n<p>In Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015\">reverted back</a> to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-powershell\">C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\CLI2\\wbin\\azps.ps1 keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value \"abc123|whoami\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"more-information\">More information</h2>\n<h3 id=\"powershell-parsing-with-azure-cli\">PowerShell Parsing with Azure CLI</h3>\n<p>PowerShell’s input parsing design has caused regressions and issues in Azure CLI’s behavior resulting in broken scripts and pipelines.  Below are the known issues and links to GitHub issues. This should not be taken as a complete list since these are <strong><em>only the reported</em></strong> issues. Users should verify command effectiveness before use in production environments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23797\">PowerShell arrays can't be passed to Azure CLI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24034\">Argument passthrough token (<code>--</code>) doesn't work with Azure CLI in PowerShell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24114\">Stop parsing token (<code>--%</code>) no longer works with Azure CLI in PowerShell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/2388\">stdin passing is interrupted for Azure CLI in PowerShell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23880\">Azure CLI returns 0 when failing in PowerShell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015\">Azure CLI can no longer be invoked by <code>Start-Process</code></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To avoid these breaking changes, in Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015\">reverted back</a> to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>🗒️ The .ps1 entry script is only required for similarly identified scenarios like the example above.
