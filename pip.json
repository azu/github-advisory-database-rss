If this is the case, it is particularly important to update if you use the proxy in a publicly-accessible setting (i.e., it is available from the internet or across a network). To fix the issue you should switch to version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19\"><code>2023-12-19</code></a> or later of the proxy immediately.</p>\n<p>If you use this flow, but have also set <code>encrypt_client_secret_on_first_use = True</code> <em>and</em> removed the original <code>client_secret</code> value from the proxy's configuration file then this issue is not a concern.</p>\n<p>For all other use-cases (e.g., a normal interactive account authentication, or the ROPCG flow), this issue is also not a concern. However, it is always recommended as best practice to keep the proxy up-to-date.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19\">Email OAuth 2.0 Proxy version <code>2023-12-19</code></a> (commit eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa) fixes this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"issue-details\">Issue details</h3>\n<p>Because it was originally designed for use as an interactive, local-only service on a single device, the proxy automatically resets account access tokens if incorrect IMAP/POP/SMTP login details are provided. For public-facing deployments, the <code>delete_account_token_on_password_error</code> option is provided, and can be set to <code>False</code> to disable this behaviour, which would normally be only a nuisance, rather than a security risk.</p>\n<p>Regardless of this option's value, the proxy encrypts locally-stored tokens, and requires interactive re-authentication (or, with the resource owner password credentials grant (ROPCG) flow, the correct remote account password) to renew tokens if they expire or are reset. The proxy's token retrieval implementation was created with this interactive process in mind.</p>\n<p>The CCG flow is an administrator-level method that grants broad access without user knowledge or consent – no user interaction (or remote account password) is ever required. From 8c874c2ff3d503ac20c7d32f46e08547fcb9e23f until the fix in eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa, when CCG tokens neared their expiry date (or had already expired), and the original unencrypted <code>client_secret</code> value was available they were automatically reset, renewed and encrypted with the given login password, but without checking whether that password was actually able to decrypt the <em>existing</em> token.</p>\n<h3 id=\"detecting-unauthorised-access\">Detecting unauthorised access</h3>\n<p>If you do not use the OAuth 2.0 CCG flow (which is currently only known to be supported by O365), unauthorised account access was not possible.[^1] Attempts to exploit this flaw will be revealed in the same way as any other malicious access: an unexpected reauthorisation prompt from the proxy when trying to log in with the legitimate account details.</p>\n<p>When using the CCG flow, if you have set <code>delete_account_token_on_password_error = False</code>, unauthorised access will be revealed by the presence of an unexpected login failure from the proxy when attempting to log in with the correct password.</p>\n<p>It you have not set this value, it is not possible to detect unauthorised access in O365 CCG mode except via AAD/Entra or other external logs. However, it is also worth reiterating that the CCG flow should never be used in a publicly-accessible context due to the significant and potentially dangerous account control it provides.</p>\n<p>[^1]: If you are using a provider that does not provide an OAuth 2.0 refresh token (or have configured your account's scope so that this is not present), it is possible to trigger the line of code that caused this issue, but there is no way to use it for account access because interactive authentication is still required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-9wgg-m99q-hhfc\">https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-9wgg-m99q-hhfc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/commit/8c874c2ff3d503ac20c7d32f46e08547fcb9e23f\">https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/commit/8c874c2ff3d503ac20c7d32f46e08547fcb9e23f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/commit/eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa\">https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/commit/eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19\">https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wgg-m99q-hhfc\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wgg-m99q-hhfc</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h3>\n<p>To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.</strong> </p>\n<p>As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (<a href=\"mailto:chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</a>) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*<a href=\"mailto:-etm@openssh.com\">-etm@openssh.com</a> MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.</p>\n<p>The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.</p>\n<p>In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.</p>\n<p>For more details see <a href=\"https://terrapin-attack.com\">https://terrapin-attack.com</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (<a href=\"mailto:chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</a>) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*<a href=\"mailto:-etm@openssh.com\">-etm@openssh.com</a>), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a

Terrapin attack), which allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to strip an arbitrary number of messages right after the initial key exchange, breaking SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) in the process and thus downgrading connection security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h3>\n<p>To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support for strict key exchange has been added to AsyncSSH in the patched version. </p>\n<p><strong>Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.</strong> </p>\n<p>As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (<code>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</code>) and Encrypt-then-MAC (<code>*-etm@openssh.com</code> MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.</p>\n<p>The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.</p>\n<p>In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.</p>\n<p>For more details and a pre-print of the associated research paper, see <a href=\"https://terrapin-attack.com\">https://terrapin-attack.com</a>.

These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/security/advisories/GHSA-hfmc-7525-mj55\">https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/security/advisories/GHSA-hfmc-7525-mj55</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/0bc73254f41acb140187e0c89606311f88de5b7b\">https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/0bc73254f41acb140187e0c89606311f88de5b7b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/69f5a41b458b29367a65fe469c2b0255b5db210a\">https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/69f5a41b458b29367a65fe469c2b0255b5db210a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hfmc-7525-mj55\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hfmc-7525-mj55</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Tests showed that this occurs when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The request is not authenticated and</li>\n<li>The request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet (<code>10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fd00::/8, ::ffff:10.0.0.0/104, ::ffff:172.16.0.0/108, ::ffff:192.168.0.0/112</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly (see <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/12/06/release-202312/\">release blog post</a>) and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.</p>\n<p>However, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Place a Home Assistant instance on a private subnet, i.e., 192.168.1.0/24.</li>\n<li>Create a few users, let's say, three.</li>\n<li>From any (or another) private subnet on the LAN, like 192.168.2.0/24, open an incognito browser window (to ensure that the browser has no cookies from Home Assistant and therefore is demonstrably unauthenticated) and navigate to the Home Assistant URL.</li>\n<li>The login page will display all three users, including their profile photo.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The following CVSS string could be shaped to describe the overall impact of this issue:\nAV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N</p>\n<p>As seen, the Exploitability metrics are high, and the Impact metrics are low. This is fitting because the problem does not constitute a critical one, but at the same time, it is trivial to exploit. Still, since the mitigation can be so easily implemented in code to eliminate a typical case of information disclosure, it would certainly be worth pursuing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-jqpc-rc7g-vf83\">https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-jqpc-rc7g-vf83</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50715\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50715</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/commit/dbfc5ea8f96bde6cd165892f5a6a6f9a65731c76\">https://github.com/home-assistant/core/commit/dbfc5ea8f96bde6cd165892f5a6a6f9a65731c76</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqpc-rc7g-vf83\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqpc-rc7g-vf83</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
