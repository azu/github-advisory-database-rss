Concretely, the <code>height</code> variable is miscalculated.\nThe vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the <code>IR</code> by hand. That is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code, it can only be triggered by using the <code>fang</code> binary directly (this binary used to be called <code>vyper-ir</code> prior to v0.3.4).</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>To compile <code>sha3_64</code>, the <code>arg[0]</code> and <code>arg[1]</code> have to be compiled:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586\">https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586</a></p>\n<p>As can be seen, after compiling the 0th arg, the <code>height</code> variable isn't increased. If new <code>withargs</code> are defined in the inner scope, they are manipulated correctly, because both their <code>height</code> is off and also the global <code>height</code> is off and thus their placement on the stack is computed correctly.</p>\n<p><code>sha3_64</code> is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the <code>key</code> was found, the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated <code>IR</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>Suppose the following hand-written IR:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-lisp\">(with _loc\n    (with val 1 \n        (with key 2 \n            (sha3_64 val key))) \n                (seq \n                    (sstore _loc \n                    (with x (sload _loc) \n                        (with ans (add x 1) (seq (assert (ge ans x)) ans))))))\n</code></pre>\n<p>after compilation:</p>\n<pre><code>the generated bytecode: 6001600281806020525f5260405f2090509050805460018101818110610026579050815550005b5f80fd\n\n0000    60  PUSH1 0x01\n0002    60  PUSH1 0x02\n0004    81  DUP2\n0005    80  DUP1       *********** bad code here!!!!!!\n0006    60  PUSH1 0x20\n0008    52  MSTORE\n</code></pre>\n<p>It can be seen that the second <code>DUP</code> will dup the item on the top of the stack which is incorrect.</p>\n<p>tracking in <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/4062\">https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/4062</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Versions v0.2.0-v0.3.10 were evaluated, and access of the variable with the invalid height is not reachable from IR generated by the vyper front-end.
