The vulnerability exists due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically within the survey redirect parameter. This flaw allows an attacker to redirect users to a specified URL after completing a survey, without proper validation of the 'redirect' parameter. Consequently, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session. This vulnerability could be exploited to steal cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5062\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5062</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/commit/21edd863c0ba53c1110b6f018a07c2d6853cf6d4\">https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/commit/21edd863c0ba53c1110b6f018a07c2d6853cf6d4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://huntr.com/bounties/ceddd3c1-a9da-4d6c-85c4-41d4d1e1102f\">https://huntr.com/bounties/ceddd3c1-a9da-4d6c-85c4-41d4d1e1102f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3434-hc3m-8mmm\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3434-hc3m-8mmm</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the create_conda_env function of the parisneo/lollms repository. The vulnerability arises from the use of shell=True in the subprocess.Popen function, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the env_name and python_version parameters. This issue could lead to a serious security breach as demonstrated by the ability to execute the 'whoami' command among potentially other harmful commands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3121\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3121</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://huntr.com/bounties/db57c343-9b80-4c1c-9ab0-9eef92c9b27b\">https://huntr.com/bounties/db57c343-9b80-4c1c-9ab0-9eef92c9b27b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79h8-gxhq-q3jg\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79h8-gxhq-q3jg</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
