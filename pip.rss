        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="observation">Observation</h3>
<p>When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as <code>git clone</code>. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (<code>-</code>) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables.</p>
<p>To clone a repository, Poetry builds a git clone command, but fails to validate or sanitize the repository location properly:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/ad33bc2f92be03dc5b31a666664903c439fb1173/poetry/core/vcs/git.py#L207"><code>poetry/core/vcs/git.py</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def clone(self, repository: str, dest: Path) -&gt; str:
    return self.run("clone", "--recurse-submodules", repository, str(dest))
</code></pre>
<p>Since this value comes from the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems.
Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory.
This kind of attack vector has been used in the past to target security researchers by sending them projects to collaborate on, so we believe that there is a non-negligible risk.</p>

<p>In Nautobot 2.0.x, certain REST API endpoints, in combination with the <code>?depth=&lt;N&gt;</code> query parameter, can expose hashed user passwords as stored in the database to any authenticated user with access to these endpoints. </p>

<p>This information is not exposed during direct access to the <code>/api/users/users/</code> endpoint, but can be exposed through any endpoint which contains a nested reference to User object(s) when an appropriate <code>?depth=&lt;N&gt;</code> query parameter is specified. Known impacted endpoints include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/api/dcim/rack-reservations/?depth=1</code>(or any greater <code>depth</code> value)</li>
<li><code>/api/extras/job-results/?depth=1</code> (or any greater <code>depth</code> value)</li>

<li><code>/api/users/permissions/?depth=1</code> (or any greater <code>depth</code> value)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Plugin REST API endpoints for any models with a foreign key to the User model may also be impacted by this issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The patch identified below mitigates the issue for both Nautobot core REST APIs and plugin REST APIs; no code change in plugins is required to address this issue.</p>

<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4692">https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4692</a> for the patch that resolved this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Upgrading to v2.0.3 or later, or applying the above patch, is the preferred workaround for this issue; while it could also be partially mitigated by updating permissions to deny user access to the above list of impacted REST API endpoints, that is not recommended as other endpoints may also expose this issue until patched.</p>

<p>The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the <code>GET api/v1/config</code> endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users.</p>
<p>This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. </p>
<p>It was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources.</p>
<p>Exploitation is limited to API clients with the <code>CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER</code> authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version <code>2.22.1</code>. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There are no workarounds.</p>
