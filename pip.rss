<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability is a <strong>data validation issue</strong> in the Gradio <code>Dropdown</code> component's pre-processing step. Even if the <code>allow_custom_value</code> parameter is set to <code>False</code>, attackers can bypass this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary values, effectively breaking the developer’s intended input constraints. While this alone is not a severe vulnerability, it can lead to more critical security issues, particularly when paired with other vulnerabilities like file downloads from the user's machine.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, this issue is addressed in <code>gradio&gt;=5.0</code>. Please upgrade to the latest version to resolve the problem.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>To mitigate the issue without upgrading, developers can add manual validation in their prediction function to check the received values against the allowed dropdown values before processing them.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability involves <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong> on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files, the scripts will execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=5</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability involves <strong>insecure communication</strong> between the FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client and server when Gradio's <code>share=True</code> option is used. HTTPS is not enforced on the connection, allowing attackers to intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos publicly over the internet using <code>share=True</code> without proper encryption, exposing sensitive data to potential eavesdroppers.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=5</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can avoid using <code>share=True</code> in production environments and instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure communication.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability relates to <strong>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</strong> in the <code>/queue/join</code> endpoint. Gradio’s <code>async_save_url_to_cache</code> function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=5</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally, implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the <code>/queue/join</code> endpoint can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability relates to <strong>CORS origin validation accepting a null origin</strong>. When a Gradio server is deployed locally, the <code>localhost_aliases</code> variable includes "null" as a valid origin. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft, such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This impacts users running Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=5.0</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can manually modify the <code>localhost_aliases</code> list in their local Gradio deployment to exclude "null" as a valid origin. By removing this value, the Gradio server will no longer accept requests from sandboxed iframes or sources with a null origin, mitigating the potential for exploitation.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability relates to the <strong>bypass of directory traversal checks</strong> within the <code>is_in_or_equal</code> function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using <code>..</code> (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradio’s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=5.0</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the <code>is_in_or_equal</code> function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of <code>..</code> sequences or malformed paths.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><strong>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability is related to <strong>CORS origin validation</strong>, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Yes, please upgrade to <code>gradio&gt;=4.44</code> to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</strong></p>
<p>As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the <code>CustomCORSMiddleware</code> class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.</p>
