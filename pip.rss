        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h7cm-mrvq-wcfr</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h7cm-mrvq-wcfr"/>
        <updated>2023-09-12T13:50:24.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p><em>Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.</em></p>
<p>The current implementation of <code>BaseUser.login</code> leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on it's own does not also enforce strong passwords (see <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implement-proper-password-strength-controls">here</a>), these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform.</p>
<p>The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform.
The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p><em>Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability relates to <a href="https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/apps/user/tables.py#L191-L237">this</a> code. Specifically the fact that responses are not returned in constant time, but rather are based off the internal state.</p>
<p>For example, if a user does not exist then <code>None</code> is returned immediately instead of encountering a time expensive hash comparison (Line 225). This discrepancy allows a malicious user to time requests made in order to generate a list of usernames which are valid on the underlying platform for usage in further attacks.</p>
<p>If your curious for some more information regarding this attack avenue, I wrote a blog post awhile back with a similar chain to this with some other types of analysis. It lives <a href="https://skelmis.co.nz/posts/tbue/">here</a>. </p>

<p>I have included the results from both versions to highlight that this issue is not as a result of <a href="https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/pull/881">this</a> pull request but as a result of the underlying logic in usage.</p>
<p>Both of these runs clearly show a noticeable difference in the time to response for valid and invalid users which would allow a malicious user to build up a list of users for usage in further attacks against the website. For example, after building up a user list a malicious user may then conduct a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack">password spray attack</a> using common passwords in order to takeover user accounts on the platform.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em></p>
<p>This is an information disclosure vulnerability. 
It would affect any Piccolo site, and all users of said Piccolo site who can login via regular login portals.</p>

<p>An unsafe extraction is being performed using <code>tarfile.extractall()</code> from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip or a ZipSlip variant.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So, a remotely available tarball is being retrieved and written to the server filesystem in chunks, and then, if the extension ends with <code>.tar.gz</code> of a compressed tarball, the mindsdb app applies <code>tarfile.extractall()</code> directly with no checks for the destination. </p>
<p>However, according to the following <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall">warning</a> from the official documentation;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with "/" or filenames with two dots "..". </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>The following PoC is provided for illustration purposes only. It showcases the risk of extracting a non-harmless text file <code>sim4n6.txt</code> to one of the parent locations rather than the intended current folder.</p>

<li>Use a safer module, like <code>zipfile</code>.</li>
<li>Use an alternative of <code>tarfile</code>, such as <code>tarsafe</code>. </li>
<li>Validate the location or the absolute path of the extracted files and discard those with malicious paths such as relative path <code>../../..</code> or absolute path such as <code>/etc/password</code>. A simple wrapper could be written to raise an exception when a path traversal may be identified.</li>
</ul>

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability has been identified in BinderHub, where providing BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the BinderHub context, with the potential to egress credentials of the BinderHub deployment, including JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry credentials. This may provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on the underlying kubernetes configuration.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>/-/api</code> API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>To work around this issue, block all traffic to the <code>/-/api</code> endpoint. This can be done with a proxy such as Apache or NGINX, or by installing the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-block">datasette-block</a> plugin and adding the following configuration to your <code>metadata.json</code> or <code>metadata.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-block": {
            "prefixes": ["/-/api"]
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette <code>/database</code> hierarchy.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pmxq-pj47-j8j4</id>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The proxy mode of WireMock, can be protected by the network restrictions configuration, as documented in <a href="https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses">Preventing proxying to and recording from specific target addresses</a>. These restrictions can be configured using the domain names, and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar patch was applied in WireMock 3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions.</p>
<p>The root cause of the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition triggered by a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial validation and the outbound network request that might go to a domain that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service is required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity and limited impact.</p>
<h3 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>WireMock 3,x until 3.0.3 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network</li>
<li>WireMock 2.x until 2.35.1 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network</li>
<li>Python WireMock until 2.6.1</li>
<li>WireMock Studio - all versions, this proprietary product was discontinued in 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<ul>
<li>WireMock 3.0.3 + the 3.0.3-1 Docker image</li>
<li>WireMock 2.35.1 + the 2.35.1-1 Docker image - backport to WireMock 2.x</li>
<li>Python WireMock 2.6.1</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>For WireMock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Configure WireMock to use IP addresses instead of the domain names in the outbound URLs subject to DNS rebinding</li>
<li>Option 2: Use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations</li>
</ul>
<p>For WireMock Studio: N/A. Switch to another distribution, there will be no fix provided. The vendor of former WireMock Studio recommends migration to <a href="https://www.wiremock.io/product">WireMock Cloud</a></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the <code>.git</code> directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the <code>.git</code> directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is present in</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175">https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175</a></p>
<p>That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if the final path is located outside the base directory.</p>
<p>I was able to exploit it from three places, but there may be more code paths that lead to it:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L605">https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L605</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L620">https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L620</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/index/base.py#L1353">https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/index/base.py#L1353</a></p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>Running GitPython within any repo should work, here is an example with the GitPython repo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import git

r = git.Repo(".")

# This will make GitPython read the README.md file from the root of the repo
r.commit("../README.md")
r.tree("../README.md")
r.index.diff("../README.md")

# Reading /etc/random
# WARNING: this will probably halt your system, run with caution
# r.commit("../../../../../../../../../dev/random")
</code></pre>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>I wasn't able to show the contents of the files (that's why "blind" local file inclusion), depending on how GitPython is being used, this can be used by an attacker for something <em>inoffensive</em> as checking if a file exits, or cause a DoS by making GitPython read a big/infinite file (like <code>/dev/random</code> on Linux systems).</p>
<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h3>
<p>A solution would be to check that the final path isn't located outside the <code>repodir</code> path (maybe even after resolving symlinks). Maybe there could be other checks in place to make sure that the reference names are valid.</p>
