<p>Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution</p>
<p>node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.</p>
<p>This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 "short path" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.</p>
<p>The v3 branch of <code>node-tar</code> has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of <code>node-tar</code>. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const tar = require('tar')

tar.x({

  filter: (file, entry) =&gt; {
    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {
      return false
    } else {

<p>Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.</p>
<h4 id="fix">Fix</h4>
<p>The problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>String.normalize('NFKD')</code> method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.</li>
<li>All slashes are normalized to <code>/</code> on Windows systems (on posix systems, <code>\</code> is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).</li>
<li>When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>protobuf.js (aka protobufjs) 6.10.0 until 6.11.4 and 7.0.0 until 7.2.4 allows Prototype Pollution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-25878. A user-controlled protobuf message can be used by an attacker to pollute the prototype of Object.prototype by adding and overwriting its data and functions. Exploitation can involve: (1) using the function parse to parse protobuf messages on the fly, (2) loading .proto files by using load/loadSync functions, or (3) providing untrusted input to the functions ReflectionObject.setParsedOption and util.setProperty. NOTE: this CVE Record is about <code>Object.constructor.prototype.&lt;new-property&gt; = ...;</code> whereas CVE-2022-25878 was about <code>Object.__proto__.&lt;new-property&gt; = ...;</code> instead.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>protobuf.js (aka protobufjs) 6.10.0 until 6.11.4 and 7.0.0 until 7.2.4 allows Prototype Pollution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-25878. A user-controlled protobuf message can be used by an attacker to pollute the prototype of Object.prototype by adding and overwriting its data and functions. Exploitation can involve: (1) using the function parse to parse protobuf messages on the fly, (2) loading .proto files by using load/loadSync functions, or (3) providing untrusted input to the functions ReflectionObject.setParsedOption and util.setProperty. NOTE: this CVE Record is about <code>Object.constructor.prototype.&lt;new-property&gt; = ...;</code> whereas CVE-2022-25878 was about <code>Object.__proto__.&lt;new-property&gt; = ...;</code> instead.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>When <code>ui.isAccessAllowed</code> is <code>undefined</code>, the <code>adminMeta</code> GraphQL query is publicly accessible, that is to say, no session is required for the query.</p>
<p>This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI middleware, which by default will only be publicly accessible if a <code>session</code> strategy is not defined. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability does not affect developers using the <code>@keystone-6/auth</code> package, or any users that have written their own <code>ui.isAccessAllowed</code> (that is to say, you are unaffected if <code>ui.isAccessAllowed</code> is defined).</p>
<p>This vulnerability does affect developers who thought that their <code>session</code> strategy will, by default, enforce that <code>adminMeta</code> is inaccessible by the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of the AdminUI middleware.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This vulnerability has been patched in <code>@keystone-6/core</code> version <code>5.5.1</code>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/tree/main#2-enable-javascript">docs</a>, svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in XSS. </p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>When trying to sanitize the svg the lib <a href="https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/blob/main/svg-loader.js#L125-L128">removes event attributes</a> such as <code>onmouseover</code>, <code>onclick</code> but the list of events is not exhaustive. Here's a list of events not removed by svg-loader. 
<code>onafterscriptexecute, onbeforecopy, onbeforecut, onbeforescriptexecute, onbeforetoggle, onbegin, onbounce, onend, onfinish, onfocusin, onfocusout, onmousewheel, onpointerrawupdate, onrepeat, onsearch, onshow, onstart, ontoggle(popover), ontouchend, ontouchmove, ontouchstart</code>
As you can see in the POC we can use <code>onbegin</code> in <code>animate</code> tag to execute JS code without needing to add <code>data-js="enabled"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src="./dist/svg-loader.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;svg data-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiIGJhc2VQcm9maWxlPSJmdWxsIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPgogIDxwb2x5Z29uIGlkPSJ0cmlhbmdsZSIgcG9pbnRzPSIwLDAgMCw1MCA1MCwwIiBmaWxsPSIjMDA5OTAwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDQ0MDAiLz4KICA8YW5pbWF0ZSBvbmJlZ2luPWFsZXJ0KDEpIGF0dHJpYnV0ZU5hbWU9eCBkdXI9MXM+Cjwvc3ZnPgo="&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src, upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7h45-grc5-89wq</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7h45-grc5-89wq"/>
        <updated>2023-08-15T13:32:05.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Svelecte item names are rendered as raw HTML with no escaping. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML into the Svelecte dropdown. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript whenever a Svelecte dropdown is opened.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Item names given to Svelecte appear to be directly rendered as HTML by the default item renderer. This means that any HTML tags in the name are rendered as HTML elements not as text.</p>
<p>Note that the custom item renderer shown in <a href="https://mskocik.github.io/svelecte/#item-rendering">https://mskocik.github.io/svelecte/#item-rendering</a> is also vulnerable to the same exploit.</p>
<p>To prevent this all special HTML characters in item names should be escaped (for example using <code>document.createTextNode()</code>).</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<pre><code class="language-svelte">&lt;script&gt;
    import Svelecte from 'svelecte';
    
    const list = [
        { id: 1, name: `Item 1` },
        { id: 2, name: `Item 2&lt;img style="display:none;" src=1 onerror="alert('JavaScript executed!');"/&gt;` },
        { id: 3, name: 'Item 3'}
    ];
&lt;/script&gt;
    
&lt;Svelecte options={list}&gt;&lt;/Svelecte&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This code snippet demonstrates how the vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript without the user's knowledge when the Svelecte dropdown is opened (note that visually item 2 appears identical to other items).
In this case the script is hardcoded, but in practice the real danger is that some applications may use Svelecte with items that are created by users or come from low-trust sources where someone else could add a malicious script to the item name.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Any site that uses Svelecte with dynamically created items either from an external source or from user-created content could be vulnerable to an XSS attack (execution of untrusted JavaScript), clickjacking or any other attack that can be performed with arbitrary HTML injection.
The actual impact of this vulnerability for a specific application depends on how trustworthy the sources that provide Svelecte items are and the steps that the application has taken to mitigate XSS attacks. XSS attacks using this vulnerability are mostly mitigated by a Content Security Policy that blocks inline JavaScript.</p>

<p>The <code>import-in-the-middle</code> loader works by generating a wrapper module on the fly. The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. It allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to an import() function.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This vulnerability has been patched in <code>import-in-the-middle</code> version 1.4.2</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not pass any user-supplied input to <code>import()</code>. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values.</li>
<li>If using <code>import-in-the-middle</code> and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that none of the following options are set (either via command-line or the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>--loader=import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs
--loader import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>If using affected versions to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (<code>\</code>) character as part of the scheme delimiter, e.g. <code>scheme:/\hostname</code>. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.</p>
<p>Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.</p>
<p>Example URL: <code>https:/\expected-example.com/path</code>
Escaped string: <code>https:/\\expected-example.com/path</code> (JavaScript strings must escape backslash)</p>
<p>Affected versions incorrectly return no hostname. Patched versions correctly return <code>expected-example.com</code>. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">WHATWG URL specification</a>, including web browsers and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/url.html">Node's built-in URL class</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>\r, \n and \t characters in user-input URLs can potentially lead to incorrect protocol extraction when using npm package urijs prior to version 1.19.11.</p>
<p>This can lead to XSS when the module is used to prevent passing in malicious javascript: links into HTML or Javascript (see following example):</p>
<pre><code>const parse = require('urijs')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

input = "ja\r\nvascript:alert(1)"
url = parse(input)

console.log(url)

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
 if (url.protocol !== "javascript:") {res.send("&lt;iframe src=\'" + input + "\'&gt;CLICK ME!&lt;/iframe&gt;")}
})

app.listen(port, () =&gt; {
 console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
</code></pre>
