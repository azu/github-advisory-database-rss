        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A vulnerability has been identified in the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) decryption interfaces, specifically related to the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html#section-4.1.3">support for decompressing plaintext after its decryption</a>. This allows an adversary to exploit specific scenarios where the compression ratio becomes exceptionally high. As a result, the length of the JWE token, which is determined by the compressed content's size, can land below application-defined limits. In such cases, other existing application level mechanisms for preventing resource exhaustion may be rendered ineffective.</p>
<p>Note that as per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#name-avoid-compression-of-encryp">RFC 8725</a> compression of data SHOULD NOT be done before encryption, because such compressed data often reveals information about the plaintext. For this reason the v5.x major version of <code>jose</code> removed support for compressed payloads entirely and is therefore NOT affected by this advisory.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Under certain conditions it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time or memory during JWE Decryption operations.</p>
<h3 id="affected-users">Affected users</h3>
<p>The impact is limited only to Node.js users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs to decrypt JWEs from untrusted sources.</p>
<p>You are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you</p>
<ul>
<li>Your code uses jose version v5.x where JWE Compression is not supported anymore</li>
<li>Your code runs in an environment other than Node.js (e.g. Deno, CF Workers), which is the only runtime where JWE Compression is implemented out of the box</li>
<li>Your code does not use the JWE decryption APIs</li>
<li>Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><code>v2.0.7</code> and <code>v4.15.5</code> releases limit the decompression routine to only allow decompressing up to 250 kB of plaintext. In v4.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the <code>inflateRaw</code> decryption option implementation. In v2.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the <code>inflateRawSyncLimit</code> decryption option.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If you cannot upgrade and do not want to support compressed JWEs you may detect and reject these tokens early by checking the token's protected header</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const { zip } = jose.decodeProtectedHeader(token)
if (zip !== undefined) {
  throw new Error('JWE Compression is not supported')
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to continue supporting JWEs with compressed payloads in these legacy release lines you must upgrade (v1.x and v2.x to version v2.0.7, v3.x and v4.x to version v4.15.5) and review the limits put forth by the patched releases.</p>

<p>Windows-Only: The NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the <code>.nsh</code> installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching <code>PATH</code>.

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The attacker can send malicious requests to a RSSHub server, to make the server send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary destinations and see partial responses. This may lead to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leak the server IP address, which could be hidden behind a CDN.</li>
<li>Retrieve information in the internal network. e.g. which addresses/ports are accessible, the titles and meta descriptions of HTML pages.</li>
<li>DoS amplification. The attacker could request the server to download some large files, or chain several SSRF requests in a single attacker request: <code>https://rsshub.a.com/zjol/paper/rsshub.b.net%2Fzjol%2Fpaper%2Frsshub.a.com%252Fzjol%252Fpaper%252Frsshub.b.net%25252Fzjol%25252Fpaper%25252Frsshub.a.com%2525252Fzjol%2525252Fpaper%2525252Fexample.com%2525252523%25252523%252523%2523%23</code>.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Previously, budibase used a library called <code>vm2</code> for code execution inside the Budibase builder and apps, such as the UI below for configuring bindings in the design section.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 13 50 16" src="https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/assets/11256663/5f049b64-cd99-48fd-a184-644cd312c82e"></p>
<p>Due to a <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cchq-frgv-rjh5">vulnerability in vm2</a>, any environment that executed the code server side (automations and column formulas) was susceptible to this vulnerability, allowing users to escape the sandbox provided by <code>vm2</code>, and to expose server side variables such as <code>process.env</code>. It's recommended by the authors of <code>vm2</code> themselves that you should move to another solution for remote JS execution due to this vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>We moved our entire JS sandbox infrastructure over to <code>isolated-vm</code>, a much more secure and recommended library for remote code execution in 2.20.0. This also comes with a performance benefit in the way we cache and execute your JS server side. The budibase cloud platform has been patched already and is not running <code>vm2</code>, but self host users will need to manage the updates by themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a self hosted user, you can take the following steps to reproduce the exploit and to verify if your installation is currently affected.</p>
<p>Create a new formula column on one of your tables in the data section with the following configuration.
<img alt="Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14 04 28" src="https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/assets/11256663/0f8bc19b-9e44-4e95-ab4e-6ef6278eea34"></p>
<p>Add the following JS function to the formula and save.
<img alt="Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14 05 19" src="https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/assets/11256663/1d0c9705-1a88-49b0-93e0-f385a04b5c25"></p>
<p>If your installation is vulnerable, when the formula evaluates you will be able to see the printed <code>process.env</code> in your new formula field. If not, your installation is not affected.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There is no workaround at this time for any budibase app that uses JS. You must fully migrate post version 2.20.0 to patch the vulnerability.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="password-reset-vulnerable-to-accent-confusion">Password reset vulnerable to accent confusion</h2>
<p>The password reset mechanism of the Directus backend is implemented in a way where combined with (specific, need to double check if i can work around) configuration in MySQL or MariaDB. As such, it allows attackers to receive a password reset email of a victim user, specifically having it arrive at a similar email address as the victim with a one or more characters changed to use accents. </p>
<p>This is due to the fact that by default MySQL/MariaDB are configured for accent-insenstive and case-insensitve comparisons.</p>
<p>MySQL weak comparison:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select 1 from directus_users where 'julian@cure53.de' = 'julian@cüre53.de';
</code></pre>
<p>This is exploitable due to an error in the API using the supplied email address for sending the reset password mail instead of using the email from the database.</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-reproduce">Steps to reproduce:</h3>
<ol>
<li>If the attacker knows the email address of the victim user, i.e., <code>julian@cure53.de</code>. (possibly just the domain could be enough for an educated guess)</li>
<li>A off-by-one accented domain <code>cüre53.de</code> can be registered to be able to receive emails.</li>
<li>With this email the attacker can request a password reset for <code>julian@cüre53.de</code>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-http">POST /auth/password/request HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
[...]
{"email":"julian@cüre53.de"}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>The supplied email (julian@cüre53.de) gets checked against the database and will match the non-accented email <code>julian@cure53.de</code> and will continue to email the password reset link to the provided email address instead of the saved email address.</li>
<li>With this email the attacker can log into the target account and use it for nefarious things</li>

<p>SDK versions between and including 5.16.0 and 5.19.0 allowed Sentry auth tokens to be set in the optional authToken configuration parameter, for debugging purposes. Doing so would result in the auth token being built into the application bundle, and therefore the auth token could be potentially exposed in case the application bundle is subsequently published.</p>
<p>You may ignore this notification if you are not using <code>authToken</code> configuration parameter in your React Native SDK configuration or did not publish apps using this way of configuring the <code>authToken</code>.</p>
<p>If you had set the <code>authToken</code> in the plugin config previously, and built and published an app with that config, you should <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/accounts/auth-tokens/">rotate your token</a>.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The behavior that allowed setting an <code>authToken</code> parameter was fixed in SDK version 5.19.1 where, if this parameter was set, you will see a warning and the <code>authToken</code> would be removed before bundling the application.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>

<li>Remove <code>authToken</code> from the plugin configuration.</li>
