        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts GitHub workflows using the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-build-action">Gradle Build Action</a> that have executed the Gradle Build Tool with the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html">configuration cache</a> enabled, potentially exposing secrets configured for the repository.</p>
<p>Secrets configured for GitHub Actions are normally passed to the Gradle Build Tool via environment variables. Due to the way that the Gradle Build Tool records these environment variables, they may be persisted into an entry in the GitHub Actions cache. This data stored in the GitHub Actions cache can be read by a GitHub Actions workflow running in an untrusted context, such as that running for a Pull Request submitted by a developer via a repository fork.</p>
<p>This vulnerability was discovered internally through code review, and we have not seen any evidence of it being exploited in the wild. However, in addition to upgrading the Gradle Build Action, you should delete any potentially vulnerable cache entries and may choose to rotate any potentially affected secrets (<a href="#Remediation">see Remediation</a>).</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/releases/tag/v2.4.2">Gradle Build Action v2.4.2</a> (and newer) no longer save this sensitive data for later use, preventing ongoing leakage of secrets via the GitHub Actions Cache. We strongly recommend that all users of the Gradle Build Action upgrade to <code>v2.4.2</code> (or simply <code>v2</code>) immediately.</p>
<h3 id="remediation">Remediation</h3>
<p>While upgrading to the latest version of the Gradle Build Action will prevent leakage of secrets going forward, additional actions may be required due to current or previous GitHub Actions Cache entries containing this information.</p>
<p>Current cache entries will remain vulnerable until they are forcibly deleted or they expire naturally after 7 days of not being used. Potentially vulnerable entries can be easily identified in the GitHub UI by searching for a cache entry with key matching <code>configuration-cache-*</code>. We recommend that users of the Gradle Build Action inspect their list of cache entries and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#deleting-cache-entries">manually delete any that match this pattern</a>.</p>
<p>While we have not seen any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited, we recommend cycling any repository secrets if you cannot be certain that these have not been compromised. Compromise could occur if you run a GitHub Actions workflow for a pull request attempting to exploit this data. 
Warning signs to look for in a pull request include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making changes to GitHub Actions workflow files in a way that may attempt to read/extract data from the Gradle User Home or /.gradle directories.</li>
<li>Making changes to Gradle build files or other executable files that may be invoked by a GitHub Actions workflow, in a way that may attempt to read/extract information from these locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to the latest version of the Gradle Build Action as soon as possible, and delete any potentially vulnerable cache entries from the GitHub Actions cache (<a href="#Remediation">see Remediation</a>). </p>
<p>If for some reason this is not possible, users can limit the impact of this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Gradle project does not opt-in to using the configuration cache, then it is not vulnerable. </li>
<li>If the Gradle project does opt-in to using the configuration-cache by default, then the <code>--no-configuration-cache</code> command-line argument can be used to disable this feature in a GitHub Actions workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, we recommend that users carefully inspect any pull request before approving the execution of GitHub Actions workflows. It may be prudent to require approval for all PRs from external contributors, as described <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories">here</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The  <code>embano1/wip</code> action uses the <code>github.event.pull_request.title</code> parameter in an insecure way. The title parameter is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation.</p>
<h2 id="details-and-impact">Details and Impact</h2>
<p>This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub. They just need to create a pull request with a commit message containing an exploit. (Note that first-time PR requests will not be run - but the attacker can submit a valid PR before submitting an invalid PR). The commit can be genuine, but the commit message can be malicious. </p>
<p>This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners (potentially use it for crypto-mining, and waste your resources) and can be used to exfiltrate any secrets that you use in the CI pipeline (including repository tokens). <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/">Here</a> is a set of blog posts by Github's security team explaining this issue.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-update-existing-workflows">How to update existing workflows</h2>
<p>Replace the following line in your workflow using this action with the <code>v2</code> branch name or commit pointing to this branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">    uses: embano1/wip@v2
</code></pre>
<p>Or using the exact commit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">    uses: embano1/wip@c25450f77ed02c20d00b76ee3b33ff43838739a2 # v2
</code></pre>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This vulnerability only impacts versions <code>v2</code> and lower. An insecure temporary creation of a file allows other actors on the Actions runner to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is world writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs <code>fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath, 777)</code> to set permissions on the Kubectl binary, however, this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl binary. This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run kubectl, most likely root. This attack is only possible if an attacker somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or if a user is utilizing an Action that maliciously executes this attack.</p>
<p>No impacted customers have been reported.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This has been fixed and released in all versions <code>v3</code> and later. 755 permissions are used instead.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>If users absolutely cannot upgrade to <code>v3</code> or higher than they should be extra diligent of the other GitHub actions they are using in a workflow and ensure that their GitHub actions runner is secure.</p>

<p>For a repository with the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling">check-spelling action</a> enabled that triggers on <code>pull_request_target</code> (or <code>schedule</code>), an attacker can send a crafted Pull Request that causes a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> to be exposed.</p>
<p>With the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, it's possible to push commits to the repository bypassing standard approval processes. Commits to the repository could then steal any/all secrets available to the repository.</p>

</ul>
<p>or</p>

<li>Set repository to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#allowing-specific-actions-to-run">Allow specific actions</a>. You can check: <ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/check-spelling">check-spelling</a> isn't a verified creator and it certainly won't be anytime soon. You could then explicitly add other actions that your repository uses.</p>

<li>Set repository <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository">Workflow permissions</a> to <code>Read repository contents permission</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Workflows using <code>check-spelling/check-spelling@main</code> were fixed automatically with the release of <a href="https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.19">v0.0.19</a>.</p>
<p>Workflows using a pinned sha or tagged version will need to change the affected workflows for <em>all</em> repository branches to the latest version.</p>
<h4 id="the-simple-case">The simple case</h4>
<p>In the simple case, you have few enough open branches that you can do the following on <strong>all branches</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the workflow to use <code>check-spelling/check-spelling@main</code>, or</li>
<li>Edit the workflow to use <code>check-spelling/check-spelling@v0.0.19</code>, or</li>
<li>Delete the workflow file, or</li>
<li>Change the workflow to only use <code>on: push</code><ul>
<li>this will result in PRs losing status checks (commits will still have statuses)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-complex-case">The complex case</h4>
<p>If you have too many open branches to feasibly fix all of them as per the above, you can instead do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform the above solution on all open branches for which you need <code>check-spelling</code> to be active.</li>
<li>On all open branches on which you need <code>check-spelling</code> to be active, rename the workflow file (e.g. to <code>spelling2.yml</code>)</li>
<li>On the default branch, create a dummy workflow file with the old name (this is usually <code>spelling.yml</code>).</li>
<li>Use the GitHub Actions UI to disable the workflow with the old name (this is usually <code>spelling.yml</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>This should prevent the vulnerable workflow from executing on any branches that you have not applied the proper solution to.</p>
<p>The reason for creating the dummy file (Step 3) before disabling the workflow (Step 4) is that, in our testing, GitHub may un-disable a workflow if it does not exist on your default branch.</p>
<p>Example dummy workflow file (For step 3):</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># spelling.yml is disabled per https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/security/advisories/GHSA-g86g-chm8-7r2p
name: Workflow should not run!
on:
  push:
    branches: ''

jobs:
  placeholder:
    name: Should be disabled
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: false
    steps:
    - name: Task
      run: |
        echo 'Running this task would be bad'
        exit 1
</code></pre>
<p>You <em>should also</em> include a comment in the new workflow to remind people not to resurrect the old name, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># spelling.yml is disabled per https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/security/advisories/GHSA-g86g-chm8-7r2p
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you should consider sending a Pull Request to an open branch in which you have not performed the proper solution to verify that the old version of <code>check-spelling</code> does not execute.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-upgrade">How to upgrade</h4>
<p>Perform this change to your impacted workflow file (typically <code>.github/workflows/spelling.yml</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">@@ -24 +24 @@
-    - uses: check-spelling/check-spelling@v0.0.18
+    - uses: check-spelling/check-spelling@v0.0.19
</code></pre>
<p>As noted above, if you have many branches, you should additionally rename the workflow and include a comment to remind people not to use the old workflow file name:</p>
<pre><code># spelling.yml is blocked per https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/security/advisories/GHSA-g86g-chm8-7r2p
</code></pre>
<h3 id="reviewing-workflow-runs">Reviewing workflow runs</h3>
<p>Users can verify who and which Pull Requests have been running the action by looking up the spelling.yml action in the Actions tab of their repositories, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/actions/workflows/spelling.yml">https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/actions/workflows/spelling.yml</a> - you can filter PRs by adding <code>?query=event%3Apull_request_target</code>, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/actions/workflows/spelling.yml?query=event%3Apull_request_target">https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/actions/workflows/spelling.yml?query=event%3Apull_request_target</a>.</p>
