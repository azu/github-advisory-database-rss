Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3509\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3509</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a3888f53317a8018e7a439bac4abeb8f3425d5e9\">https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a3888f53317a8018e7a439bac4abeb8f3425d5e9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g5ww-5jh7-63cx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g5ww-5jh7-63cx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
