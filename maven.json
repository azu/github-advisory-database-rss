The issue stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack vector that targets the RelayState of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables malicious actors to leak user sessions, leading to the compromise of authentication mechanisms.
