This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device.</p>\n<p>These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>matrix-android-sdk2 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption.</p>\n<p>Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleartext <code>m.room_key</code>, <code>m.forwarded_room_key</code> and <code>m.secret.send</code> to_device messages are discarded.</li>\n<li>Secrets received from untrusted devices are discarded.</li>\n<li>Key backups are only usable if they have a valid signature from a trusted device (no more local trust, or trust-on-decrypt).</li>\n<li>The origin of a to-device message should only be determined by observing the Olm session which managed to decrypt the message, and not by using claimed sender_key, user_id, or any other fields controllable by the homeserver.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>As this attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, if you trust your home server no particular workaround is needed.  Notice that the backup spoofing attack is a particularly sophisticated targeted attack.</p>\n<p>We are not aware of this attack being used in the wild, though specifying a false positive-free way of noticing malicious key backups key is challenging.</p>\n<p>As an abundance of caution, to avoid malicious backup attacks, you should not verify your new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched.

Examples include accessing message history before they joined the room but also when some network/federation errors have occurred.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2.

Such key forwards are parked upon receipt and are only accepted if the SDK receives an invitation for that room from the inviter in a limited time window. </p>\n<p>The SDK now sets a <code>trusted</code> flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source.
