If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki.</p>\n<p>The attack can be demonstrated by accessing the URL <code>&lt;server&gt;/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&amp;language=en&amp;sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&amp;stripHTMLEnvelope=true&amp;fromHTML=false&amp;toHTML=true&amp;text=%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello+from+Groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D</code> where <code>&lt;server&gt;</code> is the URL of the XWiki installation as a user with programming rights.
