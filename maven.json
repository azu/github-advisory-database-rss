Additionally, the newly introduced path canonicalization means that instances using a custom builds directory (<a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#jenkins-model-jenkins-buildsdir\">Java system property jenkins.model.Jenkins.buildsDir</a>) or partitioning <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> using symbolic links may fail access control checks. See <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/agent-to-controller/#file-access-rules\">the documentation</a> for how to customize the configuration in case of problems.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to immediately upgrade to Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, you can install the <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/remoting-security-workaround/\">Remoting Security Workaround Plugin</a>. It will prevent all agent-to-controller file access using <code>FilePath</code> APIs. Because it is more restrictive than Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, more plugins are incompatible with it. Make sure to read the plugin documentation before installing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21692\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21692</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2455\">https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2455</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/104c751d907919dd53f5090f84d53c671a66457b\">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/104c751d907919dd53f5090f84d53c671a66457b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5a245e42979abe4a26d41727c839521e36cedd74\">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5a245e42979abe4a26d41727c839521e36cedd74</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/63cde2daadc705edf086f2213b48c8c547f98358\">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/63cde2daadc705edf086f2213b48c8c547f98358</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xg4-xq2v-v6j7\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xg4-xq2v-v6j7</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
