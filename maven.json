The manipulation leads to server-side request forgery. Upgrading to version 2.59.1 can address this issue. The name of the patch is c3e6d69422e1f0c80fe53f2d757b8df97619af2b. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-216737 was assigned to this vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4725\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4725</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/3100\">https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/3100</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/commit/c3e6d69422e1f0c80fe53f2d757b8df97619af2b\">https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/commit/c3e6d69422e1f0c80fe53f2d757b8df97619af2b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.59.1\">https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.59.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vuldb.com/?id.216737\">https://vuldb.com/?id.216737</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5h9-qx38-2hgp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5h9-qx38-2hgp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Following types of the Java runtime are affected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>java.util.HashMap</li>\n<li>java.util.HashSet</li>\n<li>java.util.Hashtable</li>\n<li>java.util.LinkedHashMap</li>\n<li>java.util.LinkedHashSet</li>\n<li>Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.</p>\n<p>If your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Java\">XStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Java\">XStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Java\">xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for <a href=\"https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html\">CVE-2022-41966</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues\">XStream</a></li>\n<li>Contact us at <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user\">XStream Google Group</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv\">https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41966\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41966</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html\">https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
