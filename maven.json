This can be exploited, e.g., via the link syntax in any content that supports XWiki syntax like comments in XWiki: </p>\n<pre><code>[[Link1&gt;&gt;https://XWiki.example.com||data-x/onmouseover=\"alert('XSS1')\"]].\n</code></pre>\n<p>When a user moves the mouse over this link, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. When this user is a privileged user who has programming rights, this allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance.</p>\n<p>Note that this vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like <code>/</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are removed in all attribute names.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2606\">https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2606</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/0b8e9c45b7e7457043938f35265b2aa5adc76a68\">https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/0b8e9c45b7e7457043938f35265b2aa5adc76a68</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://jira.xwiki.org/\">Jira XWiki</a></li>\n<li>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:security@xwiki.org\">XWiki Security mailing-list</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7v-ph6g-3gxv\">https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7v-ph6g-3gxv</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31126\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31126</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/0b8e9c45b7e7457043938f35265b2aa5adc76a68\">https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/0b8e9c45b7e7457043938f35265b2aa5adc76a68</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2606\">https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2606</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv7v-ph6g-3gxv\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv7v-ph6g-3gxv</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input.

LDAP injection attacks could result in the granting of permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree. This risk may only occur when the user logs in with ldap, and the user name and password login will not be affected, Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache StreamPark 2.0.0 or later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45801\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45801</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread/xbkwwpkp3n2rs2wcxg8l26mhsftxwwr9\">https://lists.apache.org/thread/xbkwwpkp3n2rs2wcxg8l26mhsftxwwr9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjfj-qvqw-3f6v\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjfj-qvqw-3f6v</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
