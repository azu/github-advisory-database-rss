<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Framework. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework checks the source markup of a file.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=Issue-Question&amp;template=Support_Question.md&amp;title=Support+Question">open a support question</a> to discuss the PowerShell aspects of this advisory.
Please use <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424">https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424</a> for discussion of the .NET WPF aspects of this advisory.</p>
<h2 id="affected-software"><a name="affected-software">Affected Software</a></h2>
<p>The vulnerability affects PowerShell prior to the following versions:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="advisory-faq">Advisory FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-i-am-affected">How do I know if I am affected?</h3>
<p>If all of the following are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>pwsh -v</code>, then, check the version in the table in <a href="#user-content-affected-software">Affected Software</a> to see if your version of PowerShell is affected.</li>
<li>If you are running a version of PowerShell where the executable is not <code>pwsh</code> or <code>pwsh.exe</code>, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of <code>7.0</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-do-i-update-to-an-unaffected-version">How do I update to an unaffected version?</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7">Installing PowerShell</a> to install the latest version of PowerShell.</p>
<h2 id="other-information">Other Information</h2>
<h3 id="reporting-security-issues">Reporting Security Issues</h3>
<p>If you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell,
please email details to <a href="mailto:secure@microsoft.com">secure@microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>You can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.
This is located at <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/">https://github.com/PowerShell/</a>.
The Announcements repo (<a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements">https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements</a>)
will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-the-update-breaks-my-script-or-module">What if the update breaks my script or module?</h3>
<p>You can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell and install the previous version of PowerShell.
This should be treated as a temporary measure.
Therefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell.</p>

<p>The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious actor to gain control over the destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes. For applications using the SDK, requests to unexpected resources on local networks or to the internet could be made which could lead to information disclosure.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Versions of TrueLayer.Client <code>v1.6.0</code> and later are not affected.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The issue can be mitigated by having strict egress rules limiting the destinations to which requests can be made, and applying strict validation to any user input passed to the TrueLayer.Client library.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="executive-summary"></a>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the ASP.NET Core project templates. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>

<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="executive-summary"></a>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the ASP.NET Core project templates. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>

<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>
<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>
A scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed. Users should update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, and 5.7.0 (for 5x).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>
<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>
A scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed. Users should update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, and 5.7.0 (for 5x).</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em>
No, users must upgrade.</p>
