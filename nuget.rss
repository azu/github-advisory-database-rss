<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="executive-summary"></a>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the ASP.NET Core project templates. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>

<h4 id="for-existing-projects">For existing projects:</h4>
<p>If you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -&gt; New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="for-new-projects">For new projects:</h4>
<p>To remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.</li>
<li>If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.</li>
<li>If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the <code>dotnet --info</code> command. You will see output like the following;</li>

<h4 id="for-existing-projects">For existing projects:</h4>
<p>If you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -&gt; New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="for-new-projects">For new projects:</h4>
<p>To remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.</li>
<li>If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.</li>
<li>If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the <code>dotnet --info</code> command. You will see output like the following;</li>

<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>
<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>
A scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed. Users should update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, and 5.7.0 (for 5x).</p>

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>
<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>
A scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed. Users should update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, and 5.7.0 (for 5x).</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em>
No, users must upgrade.</p>

<p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>To work around this vulnerability, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.9.0 or higher</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Due to this library's use of an inefficient algorithm, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input is passed to <code>DecodeFromBytes</code> or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.</p>
<p>Affected versions <em>include</em> versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.</p>
<p>This vulnerability was privately reported to me.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users should use the latest version of this library. (The latest version is not necessarily 4.5.1.  Check the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Cbor">NuGet page</a> to see the latest version's version number.)</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Again, users should use the latest version of this library.</p>
<p>In the meantime, note that the inputs affected by this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes to a single CBOR object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if—</p>
<ul>
<li>it begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF, or</li>
<li>it does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an input is not affected by this vulnerability and an application can choose to perform this check before passing it to a CBOR decoding mechanism.</p>

<p>This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6r92-cgxc-r5fg. This link is maintained to preserve external references.</p>
<h3 id="original-description">Original Description</h3>
<p>PeterO.Cbor versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0 are vulnerable to a denial of 
service vulnerability. An attacker may trigger the denial of service 
condition by providing crafted data to the DecodeFromBytes or other 
decoding mechanisms in PeterO.Cbor. Depending on the usage of the 
library, an unauthenticated and remote attacker may be able to cause the
 denial of service condition.</p>

        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr"/>
        <updated>2024-01-03T20:06:37.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Newtonsoft.Json prior to version 13.0.1 is vulnerable to Insecure Defaults due to improper handling of expressions with high nesting level that lead to StackOverFlow exception or high CPU and RAM usage. Exploiting this vulnerability results in Denial Of Service (DoS). </p>
<p>The serialization and deserialization path have different properties regarding the issue.</p>
<p>Deserializing methods (like <code>JsonConvert.DeserializeObject</code>) will process the input that results in burning the CPU, allocating memory, and consuming a thread of execution. Quite high nesting level (&gt;10kk, or 9.5MB of <code>{a:{a:{...</code> input) is needed to achieve the latency over 10 seconds, depending on the hardware.</p>
<p>Serializing methods (like <code>JsonConvert.Serialize</code> or <code>JObject.ToString</code>) will throw StackOverFlow exception with the nesting level of around 20k.</p>
<p>To mitigate the issue one either need to update Newtonsoft.Json to 13.0.1 or set <code>MaxDepth</code> parameter in the <code>JsonSerializerSettings</code>. This can be done globally with the following statement. After that the parsing of the nested input will fail fast with <code>Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException</code>:</p>
<pre><code>JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = () =&gt; new JsonSerializerSettings { MaxDepth = 128 };
</code></pre>
<p>Repro code:</p>
<pre><code>//Create a string representation of an highly nested object (JSON serialized)
int nRep = 25000;
string json = string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("{a:", nRep)) + "1" +
 string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("}", nRep));

//Parse this object (leads to high CPU/RAM consumption)
var parsedJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json);

// Methods below all throw stack overflow with nRep around 20k and higher
// string a = parsedJson.ToString();
// string b = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(parsedJson);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The original statement about the problem only affecting IIS applications is misleading.</strong> Any application is affected, however the IIS has a behavior that stops restarting the instance after some time resulting in a harder-to-fix DoS.**</p>
