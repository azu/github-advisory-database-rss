        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Within the Umbraco CMS, a configuration element named "UmbracoApplicationUrl" (or just "ApplicationUrl") is used whenever application code needs to build a URL pointing back to the site. For example, when a user resets their password and the application builds a password reset URL or when the administrator invites users to the site. For Umbraco versions less than 9.2.0, if the Application URL is not specifically configured, the attacker can manipulate this value and store it persistently affecting all users for components where the "UmbracoApplicationUrl" is used. For example, the attacker is able to change the URL users receive when resetting their password so that it points to the attackers server, when the user follows this link the reset token can be intercepted by the attacker resulting in account takeover.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Due to this library's use of an inefficient algorithm, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input is passed to <code>DecodeFromBytes</code> or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.</p>
<p>Affected versions <em>include</em> versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.</p>
<p>This vulnerability was privately reported to me.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users should use the latest version of this library. (The latest version is not necessarily 4.5.1.  Check the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Cbor">NuGet page</a> to see the latest version's version number.)</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Again, users should use the latest version of this library.</p>
<p>In the meantime, note that the inputs affected by this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes to a single CBOR object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if—</p>
<ul>
<li>it begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF, or</li>
<li>it does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an input is not affected by this vulnerability and an application can choose to perform this check before passing it to a CBOR decoding mechanism.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data due to the possibility of deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript objects.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</p>
<p>XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner network.</p>
<h3 id="releases">Releases</h3>
<p>Releases before version 21.12.22.1 are affected. Please be careful to download any binary DLL from other web sites, especially we found NuGet packages not owned by us that contain vulnerable versions.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>A workaround exists that replaces one of the core JavaScript files embedded in the library. Using a XML configuration allows to replace the default JavaScript code to be replaced with the version on GitHub.</p>
