<p>The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious actor to gain control over the destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes. For applications using the SDK, requests to unexpected resources on local networks or to the internet could be made which could lead to information disclosure.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Versions of TrueLayer.Client <code>v1.6.0</code> and later are not affected.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>The issue can be mitigated by having strict egress rules limiting the destinations to which requests can be made, and applying strict validation to any user input passed to the TrueLayer.Client library.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="executive-summary"></a>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the ASP.NET Core project templates. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>
<h2 id="announcement">Announcement</h2>
<p>Announcement for this issue can be found at  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/290">https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/290</a></p>
<h3 id="mitigation-factors"><a name="mitigation-factors"></a>Mitigation factors</h3>
<p>This impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in <a href="#affected-software">affected software</a>. 
Other project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.</p>
<h2 id="affected-software"><a name="affected-software"></a>Affected software</h2>

<p>If you are you using project templates listed in <a href="#affected-software">affected software</a>, you may be exposed to the vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-fix-the-issue"><a name="how-fix"></a>How do I fix the issue?</h3>
<h4 id="for-existing-projects">For existing projects:</h4>
<p>If you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -&gt; New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="for-new-projects">For new projects:</h4>
<p>To remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.</li>
<li>If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.</li>
<li>If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the <code>dotnet --info</code> command. You will see output like the following;</li>

<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="executive-summary"></a>Executive summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the ASP.NET Core project templates. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. </p>

<h4 id="for-existing-projects">For existing projects:</h4>
<p>If you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -&gt; New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="for-new-projects">For new projects:</h4>
<p>To remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.</li>
<li>If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.</li>
<li>If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the <code>dotnet --info</code> command. You will see output like the following;</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio. This token, when processed by a server, leads to excessive memory allocation and processing time during decompression, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the attacker must have access to the public encrypt key registered with the IDP(Entra ID) for successful exploitation.</p>
<p><em>According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</em>
A scope change (S:C) in the CVSS metric indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could extend beyond the immediate processing of malicious tokens, affecting the overall availability of the system by causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed. Users should update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, and 5.7.0 (for 5x).</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em>
No, users must upgrade.</p>

<p><em>What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?</em>
Anyone leveraging the <code>SignedHttpRequest</code>protocol or the <code>SignedHttpRequestValidator</code>is vulnerable. Microsoft.IdentityModel trusts the <code>jku</code>claim by default for the <code>SignedHttpRequest</code>protocol. This raises the possibility to make any remote or local <code>HTTP GET</code> request. </p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em>
The vulnerability has been fixed in Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest. Users <strong>should</strong> update <strong>all</strong> their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher, if using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest.</p>
