            "content_html": "<p>The <code>heap-buffer-overflow</code> is triggered in the <code>strlen()</code> function when handling the <code>c_chars_to_str</code> function in the dbn crate. This vulnerability occurs because the <code>CStr::from_ptr()</code> function in Rust assumes that the provided C string is null-terminated. However, there is no guarantee that the input chars array passed to the c_chars_to_str function is properly null-terminated.</p>\n<p>If the chars array does not contain a null byte (\\0), strlen() will continue to read beyond the bounds of the buffer in search of a null terminator. This results in an out-of-bounds memory read and can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially causing memory corruption or exposing sensitive information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/databento/dbn/issues/67\">https://github.com/databento/dbn/issues/67</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/databento/dbn/commit/339efb90fdb980920a5e8829008abc1114f4bfdd\">https://github.com/databento/dbn/commit/339efb90fdb980920a5e8829008abc1114f4bfdd</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0377.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0377.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pfr9-2p92-qrhq\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pfr9-2p92-qrhq</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
