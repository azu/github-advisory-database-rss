Since those queries are executed under a system user session with the editor role, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to leverage this behavior to select, create, update and delete non-IAM resources with permissions of a system user with the editor role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>If a record access method was defined with a <code>SIGNIN</code> or a <code>SIGNUP</code> query and the SurrealDB RPC API was exposed to untrusted users, an attacker could be able to craft a binary object containing a subquery to provide in place of valid credentials when calling the <code>signin</code> and <code>signup</code> operations via the RPC API with the bincode serialization format. The attacker could use that subquery to select, create, update and delete resources in SurrealDB, but they would not be able to <em>directly</em> view the results of the query. This method cannot be used to create, update or delete IAM resources, as access to those kind of resources requires the owner role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Objects provided as variables to the sign in and sign up methods are now recursively validated to ensure that they do not contain any non-computed values, which include subqueries and other data types that could potentially result in query execution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Version 1.5.5 and later are not affected by this issue.</li>\n<li>Version 2.0.0-beta.3 and later are not affected by this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Users unable to update may want to disallow access to the SurrealDB RPC API using the affected binary serialization formats by conservatively allowing only requests to the <code>/rpc</code> endpoint of the SurrealDB HTTP server with the <code>application/json</code> content type. If the RPC API is not used at all or only used by trusted clients, disallowing or restricting access to the <code>/rpc</code> endpoint of the SurrealDB HTTP server will also prevent exploitation. Alternatively, if filtering HTTP requests is not possible, record access methods that define <code>SIGNIN</code> and <code>SIGNUP</code> clauses may be temporarily removed to completely prevent potential attacks leveraging this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users\">SurrealDB Documentation - Authentication (Record Users)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signup\">SurrealDB Documentation - RPC Protocol (Signup)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signin\">SurrealDB Documentation - RPC Protocol (Signin)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr\">https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/b7583a653a2c495a60630dffd663f506426db330\">https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/b7583a653a2c495a60630dffd663f506426db330</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/eab7ef5354168d4039f7f7b77042c99a52f770a6\">https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/eab7ef5354168d4039f7f7b77042c99a52f770a6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signin\">https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signup\">https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users\">https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Instead, to cover the occasional case that <code>git</code> outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation marks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142\">https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142</a></p>\n<p>The problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond the concatenation of quotation marks.

Unless <code>git</code> is explicitly configured with <code>core.quotePath</code> set to <code>false</code>, it also happens when the path contains most non-ASCII characters, including accented or non-English letters.

This happens because <code>calc.exe</code> was configured in the fake configuration file the user <em>Ren</em> was able to cause to be used, by placing it at the location <code>gix-path</code> wrongly resolved the path of <em>Renée</em>'s own configuration file to.</p>\n<p> The <code>gitconfig</code> file written by the attacker can be adjusted with an arbitrary choice of payload, or to set other configuration variables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>On a single-user system, it is not possible to exploit this, unless <code>GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM</code> and <code>GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL</code> have been set to unusual values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected.</p>\n<p>Exploitation is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations or use cases. It is especially unlikely with Apple Git on macOS, due to its very high scoped configuration in <code>/Library</code> or <code>/Applications</code> that would be detected instead, as in CVE-2024-45305.</p>\n<p>The likelihood of exploitation may be higher on Windows, where attacks such as those shown in the Windows proof-of-concept above can be performed due to the status of <code>\\\\</code> as a directory separator, and where there is no restriction on usernames containing accented or non-English letters (though the latter is also permitted on some other systems). Even then, complex user interaction is required. In most cases, a system administrator would have to approve an innocuous-seeming username, and then the targeted user (who could be the same or a different user) would have to use an application that uses <code>gix-path</code>.</p>\n<p>In general, exploitation is more likely to succeed if at least one of the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users are expected to install <code>git</code> themselves, and are likely to do so in predictable locations.</li>\n<li>Locations where <code>git</code> is installed, whether due to usernames in their paths or otherwise, contain characters that <code>git</code> quotes by default in paths, such as non-English letters and accented letters.</li>\n<li>A custom <code>system</code>-scope configuration file is specified with the <code>GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM</code> environment variable, and its path is in an unusual location or has strangely named components.</li>\n<li>A <code>system</code>-scope configuration file is absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than <code>GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM</code>. Currently, <code>gix-path</code> can treat a <code>global</code>-scope configuration file as belonging to the installation if no higher scope configuration file is available. This increases the likelihood of exploitation even on a system where <code>git</code> is installed system-wide in an ordinary way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, exploitation is expected to be very difficult even under any combination of those factors.</p>\n<p>Although the effect here is similar to <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2\">CVE-2022-24765</a> once exploited, a greater degree of user interaction would usually be required, and the attack complexity here is much higher because the necessary conditions are uncommon and challenging to predict.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7\">https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45405\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45405</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/650a1b5cf25e086197cc55a68525a411e1c28031\">https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/650a1b5cf25e086197cc55a68525a411e1c28031</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142\">https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0371.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0371.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
