The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the <code>regex</code> crate did not properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.</p>\n<p>This issue has been assigned CVE-2022-24713. The severity of this vulnerability is \"high\" when the <code>regex</code> crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the <code>regex</code> crate are not affected by this vulnerability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>The <code>regex</code> crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"affected-versions\">Affected versions</h2>\n<p>All versions of the <code>regex</code> crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from  <code>regex</code> 1.5.5.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h2>\n<p>We recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the <code>regex</code> crate.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic regexes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>We want to thank Addison Crump for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security\">Rust security policy</a>, and for helping review the fix.</p>\n<p>We also want to thank Andrew Gallant for developing the fix, and Pietro Albini for coordinating the disclosure and writing this advisory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/security/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8\">https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/security/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/ae70b41d4f46641dbc45c7a4f87954aea356283e\">https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/ae70b41d4f46641dbc45c7a4f87954aea356283e</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw\">https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24713\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24713</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JANLZ3JXWJR7FSHE57K66UIZUIJZI67T/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JANLZ3JXWJR7FSHE57K66UIZUIJZI67T/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PDOWTHNVGBOP2HN27PUFIGRYNSNDTYRJ/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PDOWTHNVGBOP2HN27PUFIGRYNSNDTYRJ/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O3YB7CURSG64CIPCDPNMGPE4UU24AB6H/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O3YB7CURSG64CIPCDPNMGPE4UU24AB6H/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00003.html\">https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00003.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5113\">https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5113</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00009.html\">https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00009.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5118\">https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5118</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Several vulnerabilities have been reported in the <code>time</code> and <code>chrono</code> crates related to handling of calls to <code>localtime_r</code>. You can follow some of the discussions <a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293\">here</a>, and the associated CVE <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235\">here</a>. In our case, the issue with the dependency was flagged by our nightly CI build running <a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544\"><code>cargo-audit</code></a>. </p>\n<p>The vulnerability leads to a segfault in specific circumstances - namely, when one of a number of functions in the <code>time</code> crate is called while any other thread is setting an environment variable. Given that in the case of the Parsec service this affects the SPIFFE authenticator, Parsec service users can encounter the issue only when the JWT SVID authenticator is enabled and being used. We have not undergone any manual tracing to understand if the vulnerable methods are called anywhere in our stack, however it seems reasonable to expect that if that were to be the case, the issue would lie in JWT validation (i.e. when handling the dates found within a Json Web Token). JWT validation could thus fail, bringing down the thread in which the request happens. The rest of the threads continue to work. Since the threadpool implementation that we use <a href=\"https://docs.rs/threadpool/latest/threadpool/\">continues replenishing the pool</a> when one thread panics, the impact on the service should be minimal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>No current patches exist as the problems lie in a number of dependencies that are not under our control (see more details <a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544#issuecomment-1024185688\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>The issue tracking the required change in the <code>rust-spiffe</code> crate (through which the vulnerable dependencies are imported in Parsec) can be seen <a href=\"https://github.com/maxlambrecht/rust-spiffe/issues/17\">here</a>. Once updates happen in our dependency chain that allow us to update beyond the vulnerable versions of <code>time</code> and <code>chrono</code>, a new version of the Parsec service will be tagged and released with the appropriate notifications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>The only complete workaround is to use a different type of authenticator with the Parsec service. </p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>As quoted in the initial paragraph, you can find out more information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the <code>chrono</code> repo issue <a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602\">here</a></li>\n<li>in the <code>time</code> repo issue <a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293\">here</a></li>\n<li>in the official CVE report <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235\">here</a></li>\n<li>in our tracking issue <a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544\">here</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec\">the Parsec service repo</a></li>\n<li>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:cncf-parsec-maintainers@lists.cncf.io\">cncf-parsec-maintainers@lists.cncf.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/security/advisories/GHSA-45w3-v3g4-54pm\">https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/security/advisories/GHSA-45w3-v3g4-54pm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602\">https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544\">https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544#issuecomment-1024185688\">https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544#issuecomment-1024185688</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293\">https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45w3-v3g4-54pm\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45w3-v3g4-54pm</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
