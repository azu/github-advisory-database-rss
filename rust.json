This would result in Wasmtime treating arbitrary stack slots as <code>externref</code>s that needed to be rooted for GC. At the <em>next</em> GC, it would be determined that nothing was referencing these bogus <code>externref</code>s (because nothing could ever reference them, because they are not really <code>externref</code>s) and then Wasmtime would deallocate them and run <code>&lt;ExternRef as Drop&gt;::drop</code> on them. This results in a free of memory that is not necessarily on the heap (and shouldn't be freed at this moment even if it was), as well as potential out-of-bounds reads and writes.</p>\n<p>Even though support for <code>externref</code>s (via the reference types proposal) is enabled by default, unless you are creating non-null <code>externref</code>s in your host code or explicitly triggering GCs, you cannot be affected by this bug.</p>\n<p>We have reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because usage of <code>externref</code> is currently quite rare.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/37c094faf53f1b356aab3c79d451395e4f7edb34/fuzz/fuzz_targets/table_ops.rs\">our primary <code>externref</code> fuzz target</a> such that it better exercises these code paths and we can have greater confidence in their correctness going forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime at this time, you can avoid this bug by disabling the reference types proposal by passing <code>false</code> to <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.29.0/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_reference_types\"><code>wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types</code></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/\">The Wasm reference types proposal, which introduces <code>externref</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to us on <a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime\">the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat</a></li>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/\">the <code>bytecodealliance/wasmtime</code> repository</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-4873-36h9-wv49\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-4873-36h9-wv49</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/398a73f0dd862dbe703212ebae8e34036a18c11c\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/398a73f0dd862dbe703212ebae8e34036a18c11c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime\">https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39218\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39218</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4873-36h9-wv49\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4873-36h9-wv49</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>As a Rust library the <code>wasmtime</code> crate clearly marks which functions are safe and which are <code>unsafe</code>, guaranteeing that if consumers never use <code>unsafe</code> then it should not be possible to have memory unsafety issues in their embeddings of Wasmtime. An issue was discovered in the safe API of <code>Linker::func_*</code> APIs. These APIs were previously not sound when one <code>Engine</code> was used to create the <code>Linker</code> and then a different <code>Engine</code> was used to create a <code>Store</code> and then the <code>Linker</code> was used to instantiate a module into that <code>Store</code>. Cross-<code>Engine</code> usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely call a function with the wrong type.</p>\n<p>Triggering this bug requires using at least two <code>Engine</code> values in an embedding and then additionally using two different values with a <code>Linker</code> (one at the creation time of the <code>Linker</code> and another when instantiating a module with the <code>Linker</code>).</p>\n<p>It's expected that usage of more-than-one <code>Engine</code> in an embedding is relatively rare since an <code>Engine</code> is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of this issue is relatively small.</p>\n<p>The fix implemented is to change this behavior to <code>panic!()</code> in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different <code>Engine</code> instances with a <code>Linker</code> is a programmer bug that <code>wasmtime</code> catches at runtime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime and are using more than one <code>Engine</code> in your embedding it's recommended to instead use only one <code>Engine</code> for the entire program if possible. An <code>Engine</code> is designed to be a globally shared resource that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire process. If using multiple <code>Engine</code>s is required then code should be audited to ensure that <code>Linker</code> is only used with one <code>Engine</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to us on <a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime\">the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat</a></li>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/\">the <code>bytecodealliance/wasmtime</code> repository</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/b39f087414f27ae40c44449ed5d1154e03449bff\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/b39f087414f27ae40c44449ed5d1154e03449bff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime\">https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39219\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39219</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7/\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
