An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1434\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1434</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7d56a74a96828985db7354a55227a511615f732b\">https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7d56a74a96828985db7354a55227a511615f732b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220503.txt\">https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220503.txt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220602-0009/\">https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220602-0009/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0026.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0026.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/issues/405\">https://github.com/github/advisory-database/issues/405</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-638m-m8mh-7gw2\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-638m-m8mh-7gw2</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of <code>OCSP_basic_verify</code> will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the <code>OCSP_basic_verify</code> function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL \"ocsp\" application. When verifying an ocsp response with the \"-no_cert_checks\" option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

We keep the raw byte-array next to the event structure inside our <code>Event</code> struct as a self-referential struct,\nso we make sure that the structured <code>Value</code> and its references are valid across its whole lifetime.</p>\n<p>The optimization was considered safe as long as it was only possible to merge or patche <code>event</code> data or static data.\nWhen <code>state</code> was introduced to <code>tremor-script</code> a new possibility existed, to keep <code>Value</code> data around for longer than the lifetime of an event.\nIf <code>event</code> data is merged or patched into <code>state</code> without cloning <code>state</code> first, it can still reference keys or values from\nthe previous event, which will now be invalid.
