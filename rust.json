            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The 19.0.0 release of Wasmtime contains a regression introduced during its development which can lead to a guest WebAssembly module causing a panic in the host runtime. A valid WebAssembly module, when executed at runtime, may cause this panic. The panic in question is caused when a WebAssembly module issues a <code>table.*</code> instruction which uses a dropped element segment with a table that also has an <code>externref</code> type. This causes Wasmtime to erroneously use an empty function segment instead of an empty externref segment to perform this operation. This mismatch in types causes a panic in Wasmtime when it's asserted that an externref table is only viewed as externrefs.</p>\n<p>This regression was introduced during the development of the 19.0.0 release and only affects the 19.0.0 release. This panic requires the <code>reference-types</code> WebAssembly feature to be enabled, and it is enabled by default. Toolchains are not known to generate this pattern by default so it's likely a module would need to be specifically crafted to trigger this panic.</p>\n<p>A panic in a host runtime represents a possible denial-of-service in some scenarios. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Wasmtime 19.0.1 has been released to fix this problem. Users of 19.0.0 should upgrade to 19.0.1. All other versions of Wasmtime are not affected by this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If upgrading is not possible it's recommended to use <code>config.reference_types(false)</code>. That will disable these modules at validation-time which prevents the possibility of a panic at runtime. If reference-types are required, however, then there is no other workaround at this time other than upgrading.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281\">Original bug report</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283\">PR to fix the bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018\">PR that introduced the bug</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/7f57d0bb0948fa56cc950278d0db230ed10e8664\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/7f57d0bb0948fa56cc950278d0db230ed10e8664</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30266\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30266</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.</p>\n<p>Although closing a file descriptor is seemingly a harmless task, this has been known to be exploitable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With <code>--allow-read</code> and <code>--allow-write</code> permissions, one can open <code>/dev/ptmx</code> as stdin. This device happily accepts TTY ioctls and pipes anything written into it back to the reader. <ul>\n<li>This has been presented in a hacking competition (WACON 2023 Quals \"dino jail\").</li>\n<li>However, the precondition of this challenge was heavily contrived: fd 0 has manually been closed by FFI and <code>setuid()</code> was used to drop permissions and deny access to <code>/proc</code> since global write permissions are usually equivalent to arbitrary code execution (<code>/proc/self/mem</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As this vulnerability conveniently allows us to close stdin (fd 0) without any FFI, we can open any resource that when read returns <code>y</code>, <code>Y</code> or <code>A</code> as its first character (<a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L265\">runtimes/permissions/prompter.rs</a>) to bypass the prompt.</p>\n<p>There is a caveat however - all stdio/stdin/stderr streams are <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L214\">locked</a>, after which <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L220\"><code>clear_stdin()</code></a> is called. This invokes <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L99\"><code>libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)</code></a> which fails on a non-TTY file descriptor.</p>\n<p>This can be exploited by widening the race window between <code>clear_stdin()</code> and the next <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L256\"><code>stdin_lock.read_line()</code></a>. Notably, the prompt message contains the requested resource name (path) which is filtered by <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L225\"><code>strip_ansi_codes_and_ascii_control()</code></a>. This is also concatenated by <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L241\"><code>write!()</code></a> to make a single buffer printed out to stderr. Thus, if we request a very long resource name, the window will widen allowing us to easily and stably race another Worker that closes fd 0 and opens a resource starting with an <code>A\\n</code> within the race window.</p>\n<p>Note that attacker does not need any permissions to exploit this bug to a full permission prompt bypass, as Cache API can be used to create and open files with controlled content without any permissions.

The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>A bug in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime results in data cross-reception during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js network streams. When multiple independent network socket connections are involved, this vulnerability can be triggered. For instance, two separate server sockets that receive data from their respective client sockets and then echo the received data back to the client using Node.js streams may experience an issue where data from one socket may appear on another socket. Due to the improper isolation of the global buffer (<code>BUF</code>), data sent by one socket can end up being incorrectly received by another socket. Consequently, data intended for one session may be exposed to another session, potentially leading to data corruption and unexpected behavior.</p>\n<p>This buffer was introduced as a performance optimization to avoid excessive allocations during network read operations.</p>\n<p>In cases where the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/net.html\">net.Stream</a> is connected to a remote server such as a database or key/value store such as Redis, this may result in a packet received on one connection being presented to another, causing data cross-contamination between multiple users and potentially leaking sensitive information.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that this vulnerability does not affect Deno network streams created with the <code>Deno.listen</code> and <code>Deno.connect</code> APIs. </p>\n<p>The impact of this issue may extend beyond node.js network streams, however, and may also affect asynchronous reads from non-network node.js Stream such as those created from files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188\">https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp\">https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188\">https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/3e9fb8aafd9834ebacd27734cea4310caaf794c6\">https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/3e9fb8aafd9834ebacd27734cea4310caaf794c6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27935\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27935</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
