Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>Operating systems have a limit for the number of open file descriptors (which includes sockets) in a single process, e.g. 1024 on Linux by default. When ntpd-rs is configured as an NTS server, it accepts TCP connections for the NTS-KE service. If the process has reached the descriptor limit and tries to accept a new TCP connection, the accept() system call will return with the EMFILE error and cause ntpd-rs to abort.</p>\n<p>A remote attacker can open a large number of parallel TCP connections to the server to trigger this crash. The connections need to be opened quickly enough to avoid the <code>key-exchange-timeout-ms</code> timeout (by default 1000 milliseconds).</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Only NTS-KE server configuration are affected. Those without an NTS-KE server configuration such as NTS client only or NTP only configuration are unaffected. For affected configurations the ntpd-rs daemon can made completely unavailable by crashing the service. If ntpd-rs is automatically restarted, an attacker can repeat the attack to prevent ntpd-rs from doing anything useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable NTS-KE server functionality</li>\n<li>Increase system resource limits (<code>RLIMIT_NOFILE</code>) to make the attack more difficult</li>\n<li>Lower the <code>key-exchange-timeout-ms</code> configuration setting to make the attack more difficult</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72\">https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/6049687006ea5b26eeac927964b5fcc80d7bde50\">https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/6049687006ea5b26eeac927964b5fcc80d7bde50</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>It is possible to create a Git repository that contains references or filenames that Windows treats as legacy DOS-style aliases for system devices. When such a repository is cloned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In references, <code>gix-ref</code> does not include a check for such names before attempting to access them on disk, which reads from the devices, though the ability to exfiltrate data appears limited.</li>\n<li>In paths, <code>gix-worktree-state</code> does not treat such names as collisions and instead writes to them, which writes arbitrary attacker-controlled data to the devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some such device names refer to devices that are often absent or inaccessible. But a few are guaranteed to be available, allowing some attacks to be carried out with low complexity. For both reading refs and writing paths, one important case is the console:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading a ref whose last component (e.g., tag name) is <code>CON</code> or <code>CONIN$</code> reads data from the console, thereby blocking on console input, including in most situations where a console is not readily available. This may facilitate denial of service attacks.</li>\n<li>Checking out a file named <code>CON</code> or <code>CONOUT$</code> writes its contents to the console. This allows an untrusted repository to produce arbitrary text that appears to be a message from the application. Such text may facilitate social engineering if it is selected to instruct the user to perform a particular action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another potentially important case is serial ports. For example, <code>COM1</code> refers to the first serial port, if present. A malicious repository may be able to disrupt intended use of serial ports or attempt to interact with a device. In some configurations, it may be possible to interfere with the operation of a physical or virtual serial console.

When such a repository is cloned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In references, <code>gix-ref</code> does not include a check for such names before attempting to access them on disk, which reads from the devices, though the ability to exfiltrate data appears limited.</li>\n<li>In paths, <code>gix-worktree-state</code> does not treat such names as collisions and instead writes to them, which writes arbitrary attacker-controlled data to the devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some such device names refer to devices that are often absent or inaccessible.

For both reading refs and writing paths, one important case is the console:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading a ref whose last component (e.g., tag name) is <code>CON</code> or <code>CONIN$</code> reads data from the console, thereby blocking on console input, including in most situations where a console is not readily available.

For example, <code>COM1</code> refers to the first serial port, if present. A malicious repository may be able to disrupt intended use of serial ports or attempt to interact with a device.

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>On Windows, fetching refs that clash with legacy device names reads from the devices, and checking out paths that clash with such names writes arbitrary data to the devices. This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>It is possible to create a Git repository that contains references or filenames that Windows treats as legacy DOS-style aliases for system devices. When such a repository is cloned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In references, <code>gix-ref</code> does not include a check for such names before attempting to access them on disk, which reads from the devices, though the ability to exfiltrate data appears limited.</li>\n<li>In paths, <code>gix-worktree-state</code> does not treat such names as collisions and instead writes to them, which writes arbitrary attacker-controlled data to the devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some such device names refer to devices that are often absent or inaccessible. But a few are guaranteed to be available, allowing some attacks to be carried out with low complexity. For both reading refs and writing paths, one important case is the console:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading a ref whose last component (e.g., tag name) is <code>CON</code> or <code>CONIN$</code> reads data from the console, thereby blocking on console input, including in most situations where a console is not readily available. This may facilitate denial of service attacks.</li>\n<li>Checking out a file named <code>CON</code> or <code>CONOUT$</code> writes its contents to the console. This allows an untrusted repository to produce arbitrary text that appears to be a message from the application. Such text may facilitate social engineering if it is selected to instruct the user to perform a particular action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another potentially important case is serial ports. For example, <code>COM1</code> refers to the first serial port, if present. A malicious repository may be able to disrupt intended use of serial ports or attempt to interact with a device. In some configurations, it may be possible to interfere with the operation of a physical or virtual serial console. On Windows, local access to serial ports is often permitted even for limited user accounts without elevation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions\">Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces</a> covers most reserved names. <code>CONIN$</code> and <code>CONOUT$</code> are also special, and are similar in effect to <code>CON</code> but for only input or only output. These names are case-insensitive and can also be accessed with file extensions (e.g, <code>CON.txt</code> is equivalent to <code>CON</code>) and with some variations involving added spaces or colons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<h4 id=\"ref-example\">Ref example</h4>\n<p>Create a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) with at least one commit. Use <code>git tag CON</code> to create a lightweight tag named <code>CON</code>. Place the repository somewhere it can be cloned on Windows. A <code>file://</code> URL is sufficient for testing if a private remote is unavailable. If using <code>git push</code>, pass <code>--tags</code> so the remote has the tag.</p>\n<p>On a Windows system, clone the repository with <code>gix clone</code>. This command will block immediately, reading input from the console. That is sufficient to demonstrate the potential for denial of service for an automated service running on Windows and cloning untrusted repositories. The experiment can be stopped with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.</p>\n<p>However, if desired, input can be provided. Ending input with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> will cause it to be passed to the application. This will lead to an error message, the specific details of which vary by whether the input is empty or nonempty, and whether it matches or does not match the hexadecimal hash of the tagged commit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"path-example\">Path example</h4>\n<p>Create a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) and commit a file named <code>CON</code> with the contents:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">warning: data loss imminent; you should run EVIL_COMMAND to back up your work!\n</code></pre>\n<p>While that example text serves to illustrate the risk, any distinctive text is sufficient to observe the vulnerability.
