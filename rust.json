            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>There is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of it's pooling instance allocator where when a linear memory is reused for another instance the initial heap snapshot of the prior instance can be visible, erroneously to the next instance. The pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime works by preallocating virtual memory for a fixed number of instances to reside in and then new instantiations pick a slot to use. Most conventional modules additionally have an initial copy-on-write \"heap image\" which is mapped in Wasmtime into the linear memory slot. When a heap slot is deallocated Wasmtime resets all of its contents back to the initial state but it does not unmap the image in case the next instance is an instantiation of the same module.</p>\n<p>The bug in Wasmtime occurs when a slot in the pooling allocator previously was used for a module with a heap image, meaning that its current state of memory contains the initial heap contents of that module. If the next instantiation within that slot does not itself contain a heap image then Wasmtime would leave the old heap image in place erroneously and continue with instantiation. This means that instantiations of modules without a heap image can see the initial heap image of the prior instantiation within that slot.</p>\n<p>Heap images in Wasmtime are created by precomputing WebAssembly <code>data</code> segments into one large mapping to be placed into linear memory at a particular offset. Most modules produced by toolchains today will have a heap image and an initialization snapshot. Creating a module without a heap image would require a hand-crafted <code>*.wat</code> file or a specially crafted source program. This consequence means that this bug is highly unlikely to be accidentally triggered and would otherwise require an intentional trigger with a hand-crafted module.</p>\n<p>One important part of this vulnerability is Wasmtime is highly likely to segfault when the slot is reused again with a module that itself has an initialization image. For example if module A has a heap initialization image and module B does not have a heap initialization image, then the following sequence of events could happen if they all are instantiated into the same instance slot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Module A is instantiated, and then deallocated. This leaves A's heap image in place, reset to its initial contents.</li>\n<li>Module B is instantiated and erroneously can see the initial heap contents of A. Module B is then deallocated and the entire heap is unmapped and reset back to zero.</li>\n<li>Module A is instantiated again, but the state tracking the slot did not account for module B so it thinks the module image is still mapped and proceeds with instantiation. Any action on A's part to access linear memory will then trap and if the host accesses A's memory it will segfault because the data that's supposed to be mapped is all unmapped.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding this all together this means that in practice modules must be deliberately crafted to not have an initial heap image to view the contents of a prior image. If this module is instantiated though then when the slot is reused the next, likely image-using, module will believe its memory is mapped when it isn't, causing the host to segfault on unmapped memory it believed was mapped. </p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Trigging this bug requires the pooling allocator to be configured and for copy-on-write heap images to also be enabled.

In this configuration the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator.</p>\n<p>This bug can only be triggered by setting <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/2.0.1/wasmtime/struct.InstanceLimits.html#structfield.memory_pages\"><code>InstanceLimits::memory_pages</code></a> to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime, hence the low severity of this bug despite the critical consequences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>One way to mitigate this issue is to disable usage of the pooling allocator.

            "content_html": "<p>OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3358\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3358</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b\">https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221011.txt\">https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221011.txt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0059.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0059.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0014/\">https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0014/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0023\">https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0023</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f63-89w9-3jjv\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f63-89w9-3jjv</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
