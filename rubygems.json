This Rails functionality is capable of searching for classes within the Rails context and returning the class for further use. Because Avo does not validate user input when updating or creating a new polymorphic resource, it is possible to create database entries with completely different or invalid class names than the preselected ones. Avo assumes that the class specified by the user request is a valid one and attempts to work with it, which may result in dangerous behavior and code execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26464774/243437854-933d94c8-4ae0-43fe-b2da-35b103e28796.png\">\n<em>In the test scenario we choose the demo app and the review resource which has a polymorphic reviewable field.</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26464774/243437954-2d947c6d-4e97-4e91-a442-405e553dd047.png\">\n<em>Intercepting the request and switching the review[reviewable_type] from “Fish” to “File” which is a real class inside Rails</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26464774/243438031-109de6d0-9370-4318-b18e-c5bcea61cf54.png\">\n<em>Corrupting the database with unusable classes will cause a crash at the application while viewing the new record or the index view (partial DoS)</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26464774/243438104-80df5aae-86de-40fc-870d-689a03cae389.png\">\n<em>Manual delete the corrupted resource in order to recover the applications functionality</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26464774/243438182-1e7eef54-73ba-47d0-b5df-4bad14859af3.png\">\n<em>Of course it is possible to use other class names or namespaces.

The classes could be instantiated at any point in the code and this could also lead to code execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendation\">Recommendation</h3>\n<p>Avo should be configured to never trust user-supplied input, especially when defining classes for records. In this particular case, Avo can evaluate the options list given for the polymorphic field and only allow strings from that list. With this white-list approach, an attacker cannot supply unintended classes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx\">https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34102\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34102</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/ec117882ddb1b519481bdd046dc3cfa4474e6e17\">https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/ec117882ddb1b519481bdd046dc3cfa4474e6e17</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/releases/tag/v2.33.3\">https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/releases/tag/v2.33.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/avo/CVE-2023-34102.yml\">https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/avo/CVE-2023-34102.yml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
